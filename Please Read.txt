This contains the saved model and the 'reportClassifier_pretrained', run the script this will prompt you to select the new report you wish to
classify. Please make sure this is on the path.
There will then be two outputs, a text file that gives the accuracy metrics from when the model was trained, and another text file that
contains the human factors the model has identified within the uploaded report. Please note these are replaced each time the script is run,
so save elsewhere or rename before running again.
