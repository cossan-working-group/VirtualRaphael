recommendations of the Safety Case and operational procedures needed to be updated. 
        In the last internal audit at the FPSO Cidade de São Mateus, held on 23.10.2014, all non-
conformities were registered in the internal control system called Synergi. Each non-
compliance was spun off in the objective evidence and, in turn, was registered as "actions" to 
be monitored through the system. For each registered share, the period of 18.02.2015 for 
completion was set. 
         Thus, from the Internal Audit report, it was opened 29 (twenty nine) shares to follow in 
Synergi, which at the time of internal audit, fourteen were classified as "Implementing" and 
fifteen with status "completed". 
          Regarding actions with status "Implementing", it was found that some had already been 
completed, but their status was not updated in the system and the evidence sanitation were not 
recorded, demonstrating a lack of structure in monitoring and updating about information 
preventive / corrective actions. 
          Among the actions that were still classified as "Implementing" two deserve special 
mention, namely: 
"Action 17: It was not possible to show the management of the documents

     Thus, it can be concluded that the failure to implement safeguards and recommendations identified 
in the analysis of risks associated with the lack of real control status of the implementation of actions 
during the unit operation stage took the platform to a risk condition uncontrolled and above all 
acceptance criteria that could be considered as a good practice. Such behavior is basic and catastrophic 
failure regarding minimum practices in risk management, and contributes to the degradation of the 
operational safety of the FPSO CDSM. 
 
6.2. Flaws in the systems commissioning wise 
      On 17/10/2009, while the operation in FPSO CDSM was still held by Prosafe Company, was 
issued a Change Management form74 of Cargo & Ballast control system (Full Commissioning).  
 
The description of the problem addressed by the change management description that the control 
system of the charging system and ballast is commissioned partially left in the conversion phase, there 
is a need to complete such a commissioning. It was also recorded that such a system has not been 
completed in Singapore because its completion would take place only after the arrival of unit in Brazil. 
As justification and benefit of change management was written System not yet commissioned, No 
control in the CCR (system not yet commissioned, with no CCR control). 
 
Additionally, it was reported that the control system configuration was not checked during the 
installation phase and the actions to be taken to complete the commissioning of the load control 
system and ballast were postponed because they were not considered priority75 in view of achieving to 
obtain the first gas operation, even with the technical unit in a position to carry out such activities.

recommendation is further enhanced in the same standard to address the specific security 
systems for hydrocarbon pumps. The standard recommends that hydrocarbon pumps are 
equipped with interlocking device (SDV - Shut Down Device) that interrupts the flow and 
stop the pump, both in case of high pressure as in the case of low pressure. In case of high 
blood pressure, loss of containment is avoided by shutting down the equipment before the 
pressure reaches excessive levels. The low pressure actuation rejoining equipment 
subsequently to the occurrence of rupture and consequent loss of containment minimizing the 
amount of spilled hydrocarbon. 
The interlock device is considered by the API RP 14C the form of primary overpressure 
protection. Additionally, the standard indicates that the security system is to act primarily 
through the automatic tracking operation by automatic protective action in the event of an 
abnormal condition detection sensor operation.

Executive Summary 

Approximately 11:30 as of the day 02.11.2015, while attempting to drain the liquid waste 

from the central cargo tank number 6 (6C) with the utilization of the alternative pump 

(stripping pump), there was leakage of the condensed material into the pumps room of the 

FPSO of the Cidade de São Mateus (FPSO CDSM), once operated by BW Offshore Brazil 

(BW), in the field under concession of Petróleo Brasileiro S.A (Petrobras).

       After alarm from the three fixed gas detectors installed at the bottom of the pumps room, 

three different teams have been sent to the location of the leakage in three different times, 

even with the confirmed presence of explosive environment by the fixed gas detectors.

       The first team was sent to the pumps room to investigate the gas detection, despite the gas 

detection was confirmed by the fixed gas detectors installed in such environment.

This team 

spotted the location of the leakage and its leader went to the control room to describe the 

response to the emergency command as per what he had seen on the site.

       The second team, composed of the brigade leader who had previously incurred with the 

first team and two members of the FPSO CDSM maintenance team, it was intended to assess 

the services to be performed for the repair and to return to normal operation.

During the 

mission of the second team, the portable detector of one of the members recorded 100% of the 

Explosive Lower Limit (LIE).

      After the second team returned from the pumps room, the situation was considered 

controlled by the response team's command, although the brigade remained mobilized.

The 

points of muster at the lunch room (temporary refuge), from the nursing ward and part of the 

muster point of the engine control room (ECR) have been demobilized.

exposed to take attitudes as typical of usual situations, how to use the elevator and prepare for 

lunch, addressing the cabins to change clothes.

Around 12:30, in the meantime the personnel were back and forth from the house ward, a 

third team entered into the pumps room.

Such team was provided with absorbent blankets, fire 

hose, ladder and tools, with the purpose to clear the pool of liquids and tighten the connection 

screws which were indicating any leakage, even with the presence of explosive environment.

This third team consisted of members of the ERT-1 brigade staff and other people of a 

response to the emergency technical team, informally gathered few days before the accident.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

This team went to the site of the leakage, four decks below the main deck level.

On the main 

deck, near the entrance to the pumps room, there were another brigade team (ERT-2), the 

technical team members of emergency response, the two squad leaders and the commander on 

the scene in order to support the third team.

       After the unsuccessful attempt to render absorbent blankets during the repair of the 

connection and the local washing with the utilization of fire-fighting hose, around 12h38, a 

strong explosion occurred.

At the bottom of the pumps room, a shock wave broke the 

bulkhead between the pumps room and the engine room, destroying such environment and 

causing the death of a utility operator of which appeared at their muster point, in the engine 

        Also in the engine room, the pressure brought down the elevator door, projecting it to the 

last level of the house ward and making an impact on every floor within the accommodation.

Certain personnel were injured, including two members of the ward rescue team who used the 

elevator and were trapped in the wreckage.

       On the top of the pumps room, the overpressure caused the destruction of the roof of its 

single access, spreading in the destruction of the main deck and causing the immediate death 

of four people: two brigade leaders (who were also the safety technicians from the unit), the 

commander on the scene and the pumpman.

       The lack of leadership from the brigade teams, the injury of members of the rescue team 

and the nursery ward unit explosion damage caused the failure in the attempt of care for 

towards the injured and missing rescue structures on board the unit.

       Around 23:30, after the arrival of firefighters, one of the missing personnel were rescued, 

lifeless.

The other missing personnel were found in the following days after the occurrence of 

the explosion, all of them lifelessly.

The accident caused the death of nine people, twenty-six 

wounded out of seven in worst cases, and side damage to the facility.

During the investigation it was evidenced managerial decisions once taken by Petrobras, 

Prosafe and BW Offshore (the facility operator), throughout the life cycle of the FPSO Cidade 

de São Mateus, introduced risks in a not managed basis order upon the platform operation.

The input risks created the necessary conditions for the occurrence of such major accident.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

        Underway of the project phase, the project criteria and the stand board for safety once 

adopted for the processing plant were not rendered in the existing cross docking load system 

prior to conversion of the unit.

        The decision also during the conversion to store condensate material (hydrocarbons) in 

load tanks was taken in opposition to mandatory requirements of the project of the unit, which 

foresaw the condensate material to be stored along with crude oil.

        In the phase of installation and commissioning, the cross docking load control system 

was not fully commissioned.

        During the operational phase, the commissioning was not completed, the implementation 

of safeguards has not been concluded, recommendations arising from hazard prone analysis 

were not managed and there had been certain outdated and incomplete procedures.

The 

Prosafe Company was acquired by BW Offshore (BW) in 2011 and, despite the ANP 

incurrence until the accident, resources had not been adequately furnished for the 

implementation of BW Safety Management System.

        The presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in the condensed material stored triggered a 

chemical attack caused to the material from sealing to the load cross docking system shut-off 

valves, accelerating the widespread degradation of the cross docking load system.

In an 

attempt to correct such problem, it was decided to maintain the operation of the FPSO CDSM 

and turn into significant modification into the systems, insulated tanks and lines, conduction 

of flows, utilization of alternative pipelines and the installation of spades .

        While operational constraints resulting from the operation from the degraded system 

were included in the physical system, the marine team, responsible for the operation of 

storage systems, was subjected to overload staff and absence of key functions also being 

degraded over the course of time.

         It was observed the stripping pump was operated with the offload closed during the days 

before the accident.

The condensate material leakage was supposedly caused by such type of 

operation.

         The leakage occurred through a flange which had an installed paddle and was located 

upstream of a directly linked to a slop tank valve.

There is evidence that the installed spade 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

did not meet the specification requirements and towards the pipe pressure class where it was 

installed.

        The research showed that exposure of people during the response actions were from a 

response to the emergency procedure inappropriate without forecasting scenarios identified in 

risk assessments and their response resources.

        It was not possible to determine the source of explosion of the ignition, however, the 

research team determined as a source more likely.

Such ignition source was introduced into 

the site of the leakage by the response team action.

The utilization of the fire hoses with non-

conductive water jet within explosive atmosphere is remarkable fact of the lack of 

understanding of the risks involved and the possibility of electrostatic current generation, as it 

indicates rules and several good engineering practices.

        On the day of the accident, there had been a delay on the helicopter rescue air medical 

service (MEDVAC), since the aircraft was based its operations and maintenance in Vitória, it 

has not been replaced by other equivalent arising from the same base.

Thus, other aircraft 

were intended for care, including regular customized aircraft and MEDVAC dedicated to 

Macaé, which as per the time it was requested to attendance at Garoupa-1 platform (PGP-01).

        The Emergency response procedures, in its different levels, were disjointed and did not 

guarantee the availability of resources in order to serve the accidental scenarios as described 

in the plans, for example, the care of multiple injuries.

        The causes pointed out as well as the evidences as found by the NPA give evidence of 

lack of structuring of Petrobras and BW for managing the operational safety of the FPSO 

The accident investigation process identified 28 (twenty eight) Root Causes, all 

correlated with the requirements established by ANP Resolution No.

Additionally, 61 (sixty one) recommendations, setting additional 

requirements were addressed by ANP research team.

Such recommendations were intended to 

prevent the recurrence of similar accidents and were directed to all active industry in the oil 

production segment and offshore natural gas and their implementations to be mandatory.

The procedural response and incident investigation performed by ANP 

Monitoring the response upon the incident by ANP 

  On 11/02/2015 around 13:30, ANP has received from Petrobras, over the phone, the 

information of an explosion as of 12:30 had occurred in an area under its concession, the 

platform-ship FPSO Cidade de São Mateus, with deaths incurred.

The statement had not 

contained details of the incident.

         At approximately 15:00, there had been a new call from Petrobras furnishing more 

details, bringing information of the explosion occurred in the pumps room of the FPSO 

CDSM, causing three deaths and there were six people missing and six injured.

It was also 

reported that there was smoke in the house ward and thirty-three people had disembarked over 

a whaling ship and were taken to the port of Vitória by the Astro Tupi vessel.

They added the 

Incident Command was arranged at the headquarters of Petrobras Organizational Unit in 

Espírito Santo (UO-ES) and other Petrobras team was in Ventura building, in Rio de Janeiro, 

via video conference with the Incident Command.

        As per such information the staff of the Superintendent of Operational Safety and 

Environment of ANP (SSM) gathered two teams in view of monitoring the incident, in order 

to: (i) approach ANP to the companies for the prompt service of any demand for event 

controlling, (ii) record the information for future investigation of the incident and (iii) 

evaluating the emergency response rendered by BW Offshore and Petrobras companies.

       The two teams gathered were distributed as follows: 

a) A team went to Vitória (Espírito Santo), in order to follow the Incident Command as 

observers, and came across to the Incident Command room late at night from the date 

of the accident.

b) Another team was in the late afternoon for Ventura Petrobras building in the center of 

the city of Rio de Janeiro, to monitor the events via video conference with the Incident 

Command, while the first team moved to the city of Vitória.

       Other ANP servers were on standby to support the needs of the teams assigned for the 

response to the event.

       ANP team remained in the incident command in Espírito Santo in the 11th, 12th and part 

of the day of 13.02.2015, and remained watching these activities on board the unit until the

event was controlled, i.e.

the unit to be under safe conditions.

Valuable to note some of the 

information analyzed by the screen in accident investigation team is inured from the data 

collected since the ANP became aware of the occurrence of the event.

Incident Investigation Proceedings 

In parallel to the response to the accident in place, ANP started an administrative 

proceeding on 12/02/2015 for the investigation of the event and determination of the causes.

Due to the initial lack of access to the event site and search activities for missing the first on-

site inspection activities took place on 03/05/2015.

As below estated, it is briefly presented 

the activities performed by the research team.

Data accrual through enforcement actions 

Beyond the initial response to the accident, ANP conducted the inspection activities 

presented in Table 1 below.

      The images of CFTV and data from supervisory system were extracted and collected by 

the ANP in the city of Macaé between the 25th and 29th of February 2015, activity in which 

were present the Brazilian Navy, the Federal Police and Maritime Authority of Panamá.

such extraction, the data were analyzed in ANP headquarter.

The CFTV were observed as per 

the effects of the explosion, it is possible to identify the leaking fluid in bulk, on the ground 

floor of the local leakage, beyond the time when the siren had been activated.

      From the information collected, it was sought to be identified the unit's supervisory 

system data information of the operations which were conducted by teams onboard when the 

accident occurred and what could have been caused inured from the event.

      The impractical way of recording from supervisory data held it quite difficult to identify 

the equipment operation, which required a long teamwork from ANP.

Besides the analysis of 

supervisory data, ANP conducted interviews and hearings with witnesses, as well as intense 

documentary analysis.

A fact considered remarkable by the ANP's research team was the 

absence of registration in the supervisory system of the levels of load tanks data and some 

other equipment considered important.

      The evaluation of the information in the CFTV and the supervisory system data enabled 

the fact-finding and points to be clarified with the personnel who were on board and together 

with the other unit involved in the management and response to the accident.

 In view to understand the scenario created after the leakage and before the explosion, 

data were analyzed from portable gas detectors as found next to the casualties.

these switches was found in functional conditions in order to export such data.

The portable 

gas detector data used for monitoring the distance tube after the explosion were also analyzed.

        The result of the analysis of data from portable gas detectors has shown the 

explosiveness level of the existing environment in the pumps room at the entrance of the 

brigade teams, maintenance and cleaning, and enables adjusting the schedule of events 

recorded between different devices and systems to the same standard.

Hearing of Witnesses 

Many representatives of Petrobras and BW, both involved in the operation of FPSO 

CDSM, as in the management of the unit and in response to the accident were convened by 

the ANP to contribute to the clarification of the facts and practices on board of the FPSO 

before the accident.

To this end, it was heard 23 (twenty three) witnesses at the central office 

of the ANP, between 04/05/2015 and 28/08/2015.

Analysis of data collected and investigation of causes of the accident 

The methodology for the determination of causes was based on the practices indicated by 

the Guidelines for Investigating Chemical Process Incidents, AIChE, 2003, widely used 

around the world in the research process accidents.

The root causes were identified through the identification of the causal factors of the 

accident and the use of fault tree methodology in conjunction with the map of the root causes 

of Operational Safety Management System established by Resolution No.

indicated in Integrated Operational Safety System (SISO).

Extensive documentation was 

analyzed and discussed by the research team during months of work and the results are 

presented in this report.

Description of the explosion accident ocurred on 11/02/2015 in the FPSO Cidade de 

Loss of containment and response to the scenario with the presence of explosive 

prone environment 

 At 11:30 am the day 02/11/2015, during the emptying operation 6C cargo tank, there was 

condensate leak inside the FPSO CDSM pumps room.

The leakage point was supposedly a 

flange upstream of the valve OP-0681, which had an installed spade.

According to data from the supervisory system of the facility2, the first gas sensor at high 

The same sensor detects the presence of gas at very high level3 

14 seconds after the first detection.

Subsequently, two different gas detectors indicate the 

presence of gas to 11h36m44s, featuring a confirmed detection of gas pumps room4.

It was 

possible to view the condensate material leakage through the CFTV images analysis even 

before the gas alarm activation.

Through the supervisory system data analysis we determined 

that closing the vapor supply valve stripping pump was commanded marine control room 

(CCRM) through the supervisory system of marine operator.

       After gas detection, audible and visual alarms platform gas was activated and the teams 

began the displacement of their jobs to their respective muster points previously defined.

At this time, the unity of the response structure was thrown functional and technical 

activities normally carried out by the teams were replaced by emergency response functions.

Thus, safety technicians turned brigade leaders, production operators turned brigade members 

of teams, and similarly for other functions, a reply structure was formed.

Effect Matrix starts alarm actions.

The gas detection at very high level is defined as 20% concentration detection 

LIE (Lower Limit Explosive) of gas, which as the Matrix Cause and Effect initiates actions to reduce the risk of 

fire or explosion, which include isolation and stoppage of process systems, starting the fire protection systems 

and closing of air ventilation and air conditioning system admissions.

The Figure 1 below, as taken from Emergency Response Plan unit 5, shows the response 

structure to the emergence of the FPSO Cidade de São Mateus, as well as muster points set 

for each of the people involved in emergency response.

It is noteworthy that during the 

investigation it was shown that some people were assigned to different duties from those 

recommended in the Emergency Response Plan (PRE), i.e.

individuals performed unforeseen 

functions in the proceedings.

It was also observed that it was not designated any personnel to 

function Deputy Offshore Incident Commander, although provided in the emergency response 

structure as defined in PRE.

At the time of the accident, the central control room (CCR) was the site designated as a 

muster of the following persons: (i) the installation manager (OIM), the offshore Incident 

Commander (CIO); (ii) Petrobras inspector; (iii) the marine superintendent, as the planning 

chief (CP); (iv) the superintendent of maintenance, as head of operations (CO); (v) the 

superintendent of production, as production control chief (CCP); (vi) the production 

supervisor (muster checker); (vii) radio backlash operator (scribe); (viii) the control room 

operators and (ix) the members of the Emergency Response Technical Team (TTRE).

       The formation of TTRE was decided on 08.02.2015 and was characterized as one of the 

front changes to the response structure contained in the procedures of BW.

This team had the 

main function to provide technical support to the team which had a muster with CCR.

       There were other muster points for people who worked in the emergency response 

function, namely (i) fast rescue boat; (ii) ERT room room to the brigade team 1 (ERT1); (iii) 

near the chimney to the brigade team 2 (ERT2); and (iv) engine room control room (ECR).

The other people on board that did not have emergency response function headed for 

temporary6 refuge, in the case of FPSO CDSM was the cafeteria of the unit, near the CCR.

      The OIM unit, which had embarked at 8h33 a.m.

of that morning in the same aircraft it 

had its replacement as used to return to Vitória, it participated in a video conference between 

When the gas alarm sounded, he was in his office reading the passage 

service and taking notice of the ongoing activities.

By the time the alarm sounded, the OIM 

headed to their muster point in the CCR.

In CCR, the OIM was informed of gas detection in 

the pumps room.

      The CIO said in English via public announcement system (PA) unit which had a gas alarm 

in the pumps room under review, ordering everyone to be at their respective muster points.

Then it was issued a similar announcement in Portuguese.

In view of addressing the supervisory system of marine team, the OIM has requested 

information from the ongoing operations in the pumps room next to the head of incident 

planning (attribution performed by the marine superintendent).

After learning of the load 

between the thanks cross docking operation, ordered the arrest of the pump and the closure of 

6 Location (walls and roof) with fire protection (A-60) in order to protect people from possible fire events in the

Requested more details of the cross docking operation to the marine 

superintendent, who informed him about the problems of cross docking and header change 

operation that was underway when the time of the leak.

The CIO also called a muster situation (time out muster), with the participation of the 

people at CCR, without, however, having the presence of the brigade leaders, who at the time 

were the safety technicians and members of brigade teams (ERT1 and ERT2).

The situation 

muster was intended the CCR team to update the CIO of all operations and ongoing 

conditions during the emergency, as well as the status of muster people on board.

The muster lasted about two minutes, having started at approximately 11:40 am7.

At this 

time, the gas detection was at very high level in the pumps room by all three detectors located 

at the bottom of the pumps room.

During the muster situation, CCR team knew not to specify 

the type of substance or the leaked amount therefore decided to send a team in order to 

investigate the problem which had originated the gas detection.

Additionally, it was also 

decided to stop the pumps ballast and close all valves.

The team assigned to this task should 

be equipped with brigade costume, self- contained breathing apparatus and portable gas 

detector, it had confirmation of the presence of gas in the pumps room.

After the muster 

situation, all three gas detectors located on the bottom of the pumps room were inhibited.

Inhibition of the detectors kept the visual alarm on the HMI screen, but preventing the 

execution of the actions foreseen in the Matrix Cause and the effect of even new further 

detection.

The CIO ordered the radio operator to call the base of BW operations and then passed the 

information about what was happening on board.

Such communication occurred at about 

While production supervisor accounts for people in points against the No.

1 team squad 

reported to be ready for their muster point near the starboard lifeboat.

Around 11h49, the first team entry is sorted in the home pumps after the occurrence of 

gas alarm even with the detection confirmed that gas environment.

This team consisted of two 

brigades of ERT1, one being their leader, and TTRE member (pump operator).

At the same

time, the staff count in the other muster places was completed.

Detectors and audible alarms 

were inhibited not to interfere with communication between the team.

The pumps room of the FPSO CDSM home was an environment in which there was a 

common control procedure for the entry of people, it was endowed with fixed CO2 system 

whose drive demanded the absence of people in this environment.

Everyone who entered the 

pumps room between the condensate leakage and the explosion had expressed the CIO 

authorized to do so.

During the descent of the first team to determine the source of the leak, the ported 

portable detectors for firefighters alarmed and indicated the presence of flammable gases.

This detection was 30% LIE (Lower Explosive Limit) on the floor above the spill point and 

100% LIE close to this point, thus indicating concentration within the explosive range.

Still, 

they went and identified the leak point.

The leakage point was a flange located upstream of a valve (PB-068), connected directly 

to the tank bombordo slop (slop P), the fourth level below the main deck.

At this time, the 

leak occurred as fillet in a pool of a dark-colored liquid of approximately 2 m on the ground.

Figure 2 shows the position of the OP-068 valve and the location of the leak.

Figure 3 shows 

the flange where the leak occurred in photograph taken before the crash.

        Inside the pumps room, the leader of ERT1 reported in Portuguese to the on scene 

commander (OSC), which was on the main deck near the entrance to the pumps room, which 

had a lot of gas in the atmosphere.

By communication difficulties due to the use of self- 

contained breathing apparatus used by the brigade, the commander on the scene got the 

information that there was "zero gas" on site.

This information was subsequently corrected by 

another person who went out of their muster, headed by the commander on the scene and 

personally conveyed the correct information.

       After receiving the information from inside the pumps room in Portuguese, the 

commander on the scene, which was near the entrance to the pumps room, relayed in English 

to the Head of Operations in the CCR.

The Head of Operations was responsible for updating 

the CIO on information coming from inside the pumps room and pass the orders of the CIO to 

the OSC.

       At 11h54, after returning the first team to the main deck, the leader of ERT1 (who was 

also technical security) collected the detectors of other firefighters who came down to the 

pumps room and addressed the CCR.

There CIO reported to the leakage characteristics and it 

was decided that the cleanliness would be made with absorbing blankets and evaluation by 

members of the maintenance team, to be planned the repair service.

      From the information coming from the first team that went down to the pumps, the CIO 

and others in the CCR team tried to identify the leak point with the aid of process flow 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

diagrams (P & IDs), but these flow charts did not show the flange where It happened the loss 

of containment.

This fact caused doubt if the leak had occurred in its own OP-068 valve.

It 

should be noted it was not possible to determine if the people who responded to the incident 

were aware that there was a spade which installed such flange.

 At this time, there was a high pressure pump slop tank (slop P) and was ordered to the 

marine operator, Member of TTRE, relief this pressure on the main deck.

Simultaneously, it was undone an automatic action of the matrix of cause and effect 

(MCE) to allow the decrease of the temperature of electrical panels within the e-house e-

Such a situation occurred, because the detection of gas inside the pumps room carried 

the recirculation mode of ventilation air in such environment by closing the lids of the vents 

(dampers) of the e-house.

Inside this environment there were the electrical panels of 

production systems and power generation.

This led to forming the internal heating of these 

panels and the resulting shutdown of systems.

To work around this problem and avoid 

stopping the production, it was ordered to return the unit's technical operation of air 

conditioning to the normal condition, on the contrary to the previously designed in logic 

systems shutdown in atypical situations9.

With the information available, a second team was composed and ordered to get down on 

the site of the leak to evaluate the services to be performed to repair and return to normal 

operation.

In parallel, it was ordered to the marine Superintendent to prepare a work permit 

(PT) for the repair to be executed later.

        At 12:00:42, one of the three detectors of the pumps room was taken from inhibition, 

returning to indicate very high level of gas to 12:01:41, keeping the same statement by the 

time of the explosion.

        The second team was gathered by the brigade leader who had previously descended with 

the first team and two members of TTRE10, who were also members of the FPSO CDSM

The second team entered the pumps room to 12h07.

During the descent of 

the second team, the portable detector of one of the members recorded 100% of the lower 

explosive limit (LIE).

      Inside the pumps room, the second team requested, by radio, a ladder and tools and went 

out for some air.

To exit the pumps room, around 12:15 pm, two of the three members of the 

second team were the CCR and reported to the CIO what was found inside the pumps room.

The CIO has authorized the carrying out of the pool cleaning, ordered the verification of 

service needs and were available sealing stamps on stock unit that are compatible with the 

Then the CIO ordered the marine operator to seek absorbing blankets for 

cleaning operation to be performed at the site of the leak.

       A third team was then mobilized in order to drive the cleaning and accessing the flange 

which had leakage.

       Around 12:20 pm, the CIO established telephone contact with the office operations 

manager in Vitória and informed about the problem and the cleanup plan.

       Shortly before the third team entry in the pumps room, the CIO partially demobilized the 

muster stations11.

This order was conveyed by notices in the public announcement (PA) 

system, as well as personal notices by phone.

       After the demobilization of warnings, all the people at the muster point of the cafeteria, 

part of the ward support team and the team's engine room control room (ECR) were 

demobilized from their point of muster and released for lunch.

Per unit rule, people could not 

consume meals with service overalls and therefore went to their cabins to change for lunch.

       At 12h27 and after the demobilization of the muster points, the third team entered the 

pumps room, even with confirmed gas detection in this environment.

For condensate cleaning 

were highlighted two members of ERT1 would use absorbing blankets.

To access the flange 

were mobilized three members of TTRE belonging to the FPSO CDSM maintenance staff.

Members of TTRE carried an aluminum ladder and two wrenches, with combined chrome and 

other common carbon steel.

The fire hose, which was already assembled, was down already 

pressurized towards the pumps room.

Every member of the third team were vested with the

brigade team clothing and portable detectors.

One minute after going down, the portable 

detector member of the brigade already had 100% LIE.

      Inside the pumps room, the third team has abandoned the plan to perform the cleaning 

with the absorbing webs and firefighters started cleaning with the use of the hose.

It was then 

requested from the team who was out of the pumps room to attach a new stretch of fifteen 

meters to such activity.

After mounting the passage and down the pumps room, it was asked 

the water pressure hoses to be increased.

At this time, around 12h38m05s there had been the 

explosion which caused the damage to people and the equipment in various regions of the 

unit.

Such damages are evidenced herein.

In the attempt to assess the problem, repair the 

connection for which there was leakage and to perform the cleaning of the leaked material 

there were sent to the location of the leakage from different timeframes, three teams who 

entered the pumps room even with the gas confirmed detection on site and gas detection on 

their portable detectors.

Collateral damage to the explosion 

     Due to the blast, died immediately four people who were on the main deck, near the access 

to the pumps room, and the two of them leaders of ERT1 and ERT2 (safety technicians), the 

commander on the scene (electricity and instrumentation supervisor) and a member of TTRE 

(pump operator).

    The pumps room and engine room were positioned below the houses.

The location of the 

pumps room and engine room and the identification of the floors of the houses are shown in

In the back of the pumps room, the pressure caused by the explosion broke the bulkhead 

between the pumps room and the engine room, causing destruction in this environment.

      The muster point of the engine room of the team was in the engine room control room 

(ECR) and this was necessary because these workers had roles in emergencies.

       The pressure in the engine room caused the death of an operator of utilities which was 

located in the muster point in the engine control room (ECR).

His body was only accessed 

and rescued around 0:00 on the day of 12.02.2015, shortly after the arrival of rescuers of the 

Body of Military FireFighters of Espírito Santo (CBMES).

After the explosion, the unit incurred in blackout, and both the main power generation 

system and the emergency generator were affected.

This fact can be attributed to the lack of 

protection forecast for this area of the unit.

In the engine room it was found several damages, such as damaged engines, loose pieces 

of equipment, and also the bulkhead separating the pumps room and the engine room with an 

open tear dent due to the accident, large enough for people to cross.

Also in the engine room, the pressure wave hit the elevator landing which crossed 

towards the accommodation ward, being propagated into the house wards, reaching the 

environments, including the nursery ward.

The elevator was thrown upwards and within its 

wreckage was later on found seriously two members injured from the rescue ward rescue 

team.

These two people had been demobilized from their muster point in the nursery ward to 

have their lunch.

2.2.1 Damage to the house ward by the propagation boost from the elevator shaft 

At the FPSO CDSM, the elevator linked decks between the engine room and the “D” 

level and it was thrown against the ceiling of the last ward on the top floor.

It can be seen 

from Figure 20 that the square of the level of the elevator door machinery moved into the 

elevator shaft, unlike the other levels, in which the door moved out of the elevator.

     This situation is considered critical, given that the houses should be the safest place the 

unit, providing for the gathering of people for normal operation and for emergency situations.

The houses was where the greatest number of people would be during the emergency, as 

people focused points against the CCR, ward and temporary refuge (cafeteria).

However, the 

houses proved to be vulnerable to the scene of the accident.

Figure 21 shows the state of one 

of the corridors of the houses after the explosion.

Damage to the nursery ward 

A serious consequence of the damage to the house ward was the spread of pressure to the 

nursery, located on the main deck starboard side, impairing proper care for the wounded.

The 

ward was another place used as a muster point during the emergency.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

According to testimonies, the explosion damage on the nursery ward had left this 

environment unable to provide any care to the injured ones.

The first aid supplies were 

contaminated by residues of the explosion and the glass wool which came off of the lining of 

the accommodations partitions.

The ward stretcher was designed to service in the deck of the 

explosion and it was found without the head protector.

2.3 Subsequent events after explosion occurence 

After the explosion, people aboard the FPSO CDSM were disoriented and disorder settled 

The production unit was paralyzed for automatic actuation of safety or CCR control 

systems, it is not possible to determine the cause.

The unit's abandonment of alarm began to 

sound continuously.

       The pressure caused by the explosion reached the houses and projected a cloud of glass 

wool particles in the air.

People who were there left disoriented, trying to breathe better and 

get away from that thought were potentially attainable places for fear of subsequent 

explosions.

There was also a lot of white smoke coming from the engine room and fireplace.

       The death of the leaders of the brigade teams, the members of the rescue team injury and 

blast damage to ward unit caused the failure of the search for missing structures and care to 

the wounded on board the unit.

There was also the fear that further explosions could occur 

and people sought to move away from the places affected by the explosion.

       The coordinator of the abandonment of whaling point of Borest tried to take the order for 

organizing people, guiding them to make inquiries down the helipad, but the excitement kept 

counting and identification of individuals.

The final number of missing only came later.

At 12h46, Petrobras' Fiscal aboard the FPSO CDSM informed the Emergency Center and 

the Sector Manager of Petrobras Production Operations worsening of the situation and asked 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

for the aeromedical support.

Later on, the OIM called the Operations Manager of BW and he 

asked for as much of aeromedical helicopter as needed.

Only after the explosion, offices of 

the teams on the ground have begun the effective activation of the external structure response 

to the FPSO CDSM.

      At one point, the smoke begins to also leave for an access below the helipad at that time, it 

was given the guidance to people they turn to the area of movement of cargo to the half deck 

of the ship.

This displacement was carried out in groups, in which people were counted and 

gradually released for displacement.

      When they arrived amidships, people of the first group viewed a person running towards 

the bow and followed him, disoriented, without knowing exactly why.

It was production team 

member who was going toward the bow to manually stop the fire pumps.

At that time the fire 

water flooded part of the main deck of the unit, some of the houses and the home of pumps 

because the explosion had caused disruption fire pipes near the entrance of the house pumps.

       People gathered then in and around the temporary shelter where the wounded were also 

assisted by the nurse.

Despite attempts to organize and command the crew to an abandonment 

by whaling starboard, some people refused to return to close to the houses and the house of 

pumps for fear of further explosions and planned to leave the unit by inflatable rafts in his 

This group was later persuaded to return to close to the houses, specifically the 

abandonment of whaling point on starboard.

       Communications between the platform and Petrobras' offices were lost about twenty 

minutes after the explosion because of UPS load of completion (uninterrupted power supply 

unit) of unidade3.

Other communications after this time were made through the emergency 

radio and mediated by the FPSO Cidade de Vitória (FPSO CVIT).

2.3.1 Unit abandonment using starboard whaling ship 

The abandonment point it was found that the minimum crew for Navigation starboard 

lifeboat was incomplete because of the personal injury trained for its operation.

The head of 

planning (marine superintendent) was then fired to man the lifeboat to possess knowledge to 

There was uproar and some people with no surrender function organized themselves to 

try to seek missing persons and others who refused to land by lifeboats.

      All the preparation for the injured landing was made towards using helicopters and the 

others would be landed through whaling, with subsequent transshipment to support vessels.

However, many of those who were not wounded refusing to use the baleeiras3 and landed by 

helicopter.

With the explosion, the T12 cards in dropout point of the starboard lifeboat were lost, 

making it impossible to control people.

The count of people began to be made by hand, called 

at the entrance of whaling, since the list of persons on board (POB) previously released for 

abandoning point coordinator was outdated.

People then entered the whaling starboard and remained there until there was a recount using 

POB updated, made available after the entry of people in whaling, and waited for the order to 

lower the lifeboat.

       The descent, which is usually controlled from inside the lifeboat, was taken by personnel 

in the platform about 14:00.

When whaling was close to the sea, its release was made with 

difficulty by a person who had no such predefined assignment.

The person who sailed to the 

whaling near the support boat also demonstrated not have a working knowledge of how to 

operate the boat.

      People were injured inside the house wards.

The explosion caused by airflow had thrown 

glass wool powder used for insulation and in the ceilings, causing skin and eye irritation of 

12 Individual identification card.

This card is delivered to each person on board the unit at the time of shipment 

and is stored in its designated drop point.

In an emergency, the card enables quick identification of missing 

persons in the dropout point.

The pressure also caused the destruction of the nursery ward, located on the 

main deck starboard side, impairing care for the wounded.

On the main deck, other people were injured, mainly due to the pressure that threw people 

against structures, as well as shrapnel projection equipment damaged by the explosion.

In the 

nine fatalities, a total of twenty-six injured, and seven had serious injury13 and nineteen were 

hospitalized for less than 24 hours.

The amount and location of the people who were injured at the time of the explosion are 

listed in Table 2.

The team formed to meet the scheduled injured in the emergency response plan consisted 

of a nurse and four helpers to care for the injured and for providing/search service materials.

At the time of the accident, all four support staff nurses belonged to the hotel staff the FPSO 

Two of the four people responsible for hospitality compose the nursing professional staff 

were in the elevator at the time of the explosion and injured and arrested in what was left of

the elevator, which was designed to the last houses of the floor.

They were only rescued from 

inside the elevator after the departure of the first rescue helicopter.

The initial care from the first aid was made with the material which was found at hand, 

since the ward was hit by the impact of the explosion and there was a certain fear to another 

potential explosion to reach the house wards.

      People were helping the wounded they found and adapted to the transport to where they 

could receive the first aids.

      The care with serum and other resources in an attempt to stabilize the victims was done by 

nurse since none of the people on board had additional knowledge to basic first aid.

      There was an office on the ground trying to contact via radio nurse on board to verify the 

need for support to perform care for victims, but the contact was not effective because of the 

great demand for service of the wounded.

Thereafter no further consultation was made.

2.3.3 Aeromedical Rescue 

The air medical rescue (MEDEVAC) contracted by Petrobras has a linked aircraft to 

Vitória operating base14.

As per the charter contract of MEDEVAC aircraft15 it is expected 

that the contractor shall maintain aircraft available every day of the month, 24 hours a day, 

and that in case of continuous availability of the aircraft, the contractor shall provide, as soon 

as possible, its return to operating condition or replacement.

With respect to that aircraft, on 02.05.2015 was informed to Petrobras representatives by 

the contractor, this would be transferred to the base in Macaé on 02/08/2015 for scheduled 

maintenance execution and correction follow-up items.

The estimated forecast for the 

fulfillment of these services would be approximately five days, with the return scheduled for 

the day 02/13/2015 at Vitória base.

On 02.08.2015 the company that provides the service MEDVAC sent to Petrobras the 

availability plug16 from such aircraft, containing maintenance activity data and the deadline 

14 Registration number PR-OMQ 

15 Email from the helicopters inspector to the Field Audit Committee of Petrobras, on 05/02/2015

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

for its completion (13.02.2015), and the caveat that MEDVAC aircraft base in Macaé17 estaria 

cobrindo a base de Vitória durante a indisponibilidade da aeronave MEDVAC.

In this sense, we found that although the charter contract of MEDVAC aircraft had the 

aircraft replacement forecast by another of the same model or technically equal or higher, no 

aircraft of the same characteristic was maintained to replace MEDVAC in Vitória base.

Moreover, it was also found that, although in item 2.5.5 of passenger aircraft charter contract 

there was the prediction that Petrobras could require the passenger helicopter remained on 

guard full time to perform salvage missions aeromedical no passenger aircraft was maintained 

full-time in Vitória base in place of MEDVAC provided for that base.

     Thus, since there is no substitute to that in aircraft maintenance, aircraft MEDVAC the 

base of Macaé would be the resource available to meet possible emergencies in the FPSO 

     However, on 11/02/2015 at the time the MEDVAC aircraft Macaé was triggered as a result 

of the accident in the FPSO CDSM to 12h48, the aircraft was making a call to an instance in 

Grouper Platform (PGP-1), of According to the report rescue aeromédico18.

The aircraft had 

been fired at 11h02, having landed in PGP-1 (rescue site) at 12h07 and taken off at 12.40.

In 

this sense, the aircraft could only meet the emergency FPSO CDSM after the completion of 

service to the occurrence PGP-1.

In this context, MEDVAC aircraft reached the FPSO CDSM 

to 15h25 arising from Macaé airport.

      As an alternative to aeromedical aircraft, was provided to adapt a common aircraft 

passenger, who did not have all the materials and medical-surgical equipment of an 

ambulance aircraft.

Is adapted aircraft landed on the FPSO to 14h53 coming from the Vitória 

airport.

Table 3 shows the information of all flights who attended emergency, aircraft types and 

the amount of people who have been rescued.

In total, six helicopters were used for the 

landing of thirty people.

Whereas, during the emergency, that: (i) the drive for the aircraft to stay on standby for

agreement provides that the aircraft is ready to meet a medevac up to 25 (twenty-five) minutes 

of Petrobras notification; (iii) the 2.7 item of aeromedical team contract provides that the 

medical staff is available and ready to rescue running on the basis of up to twenty (20) 

minutes after the the drive time and (iv) the flight between Vitória airport and the FPSO 

CDSM is approximately 28 (twenty eight) minutes, it can be concluded that the MEDVAC 

aircraft could have reached the FPSO to 13h41 if the same was available in Victoria operation 

base at the time of the accident.

     The delay of 1:44 a.m.

registration of aircraft PR-SOMA base of Macaé can be attributed 

to air medical service that the aircraft performed in PGP-1 at the time of the accident and 

flight time between the airport Macaé and FPSO CDSM, greater than the flight time between 

the airport and Vitória FPSO CDSM.

The delay of 1h12 of the aircraft under registration 

number PR-CSF can be attributed to the time required for adaptation of passenger aircraft.

      It should be noted that both delays could have been avoided if the MEDVAC aircraft was 

ready and available on the Vitória base of operation or if a replacement aircraft had been 

provided while the main aeronova remained down for maintenance.

2.3.4 Searching mission on the day of the accident 

After the explosion of the brigade teams lost their two leaders, who died, and no new 

command so that there was the search for the missing.

      At this time, the disorientation escalated, it was not known what had happened exactly, or 

what systems were affected by the explosion, neither one knew the risk of further explosions 

and fire occurrence.

People heard one of the missing who was in the engine room to call for 

help via radio and tried to arrange for an impromptu rescue, but this attempt was discouraged 

by other people on board because of the risk that the redemption offered to people due to the 

difficulty of secure access area to the site.

Around 14:00, after checking the updated list of persons on board18 and landing of thirty-

two people by whaling starboard, it determined the correct number of missing the FPSO 

While this check was made, one of the brigade's third team managed to get out by 

their own means of pumps home alive, but badly injured.

At that moment, it was found the absence of the two people who were trapped inside the 

They were located through shouts from the rooftop of accommodation for people 

entering the houses to fetch their belongings.

Despite the difficulty of access and openness of 

the lift debris, these people were rescued by the crew members and answered by the nurse, 

together with the other wounded to the realization of landing by helicopter.

      The members of the third team that went down to the pumps and were near the spill site 

were considered missing.

Around 15:00, the IOC was informed that external fire embark on 

       From 16h50, after landing of people effected by the whaling starboard and six 

helicopters, remained three people on board.

The search for the missing was only initiated 

after this time, since at night due to the delay in the arrival of foreign rescue team.

       This decision was taken because the water from entering the unit was being monitored 

and would, if no action is taken, where possibly was in one of the missing would be flooded 

       People then did the measurement of gases in the engine room with remote monitoring by 

the portable detector with running hose.

As such detector did not indicate the presence of gas, 

two of the three people were in search of the missing person and identified their position, but 

failed to make access to its rescue.

The external team of search and rescue, formed by 

firefighters from the state of Espirito Santo FPSO boarded the CDSM around 23:00 and was 

guided by staff on board how to get to the facilities operator.

The site already had water close 

to the entrance and the team of firefighters was able to access the victim but found that this 

was already lifeless.

His body was then taken to near the helipad location where the other 

bodies were also appointed.

       During the external rescue team planning to enter the house of pumps and trace missing, 

there was the order of the crisis room installed in Petrobras building in Vitória, so that these 

people immediately abandon the platform because there was a risk of structural collapse.

The 

total abandonment of the unit by the three remaining crew and fire occurred around 1:00 a.m.

through whaling port side.

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

To carry out the emptying of the tank 6C, the platform had been tilted so that the stern of 

the unit stay longer sunk in relation to its stem.

This is due to the geometry of the unit's cargo 

tanks that had beams inside, typical for tanks simples3 tank units.

      After the explosion it was found to partial flooding of the main deck, houses and part of 

the pumps house due to water ingress through the rupture of pipes of fire and, therefore, the 

fire fighting pumps were stopped.

However, after some hours, it was found that the stern-

prow gradient was increased and that water intake was probably compromised by systems 

which were connected with the sea compounders.

       The crisis command set up by Petrobras triggered experts on the stability of vessels that 

simulated the effects on the ship's hull and, at one point indicated that there was structural risk 

for the unit.

After hours with increasing level of water inside the house pumps and engine 

room, there was the achievement of a balance and the water level remained unchanged.

       Response activities after the accident took place in action to close the doors of the sea 

compounders with the use of divers and such activity has been completed on 03.05.2015 and 

missing search activity was done in parallel to the emptying of the pumps and home machine 

      The structural damage suffered perhaps the FPSO CDSM which caused the water intake 

still uncertain and the interlocutors BW indicate that such damages will only be identified 

when the unit is placed in the yard.

     At the date of issuance of such report, the unit is still being degraded due to the accident 

and operations are underway for the unit is able to be placed in safe and can be transferred to 

a shipyard for repairs.

2.3.6 Searching mission after 11/02/2015 

In the following days of the explosion, there was concern about the structural condition of 

the unit, because it was showing an inclination (trim) high.

The source of water supply to the 

pumps house, engine room and number machinery space 6, was unknown and was made 

external inspection by ROV (underwater vehicle operated remotely), in which damages have 

not been verified on the outside of ship.

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

Potential water entry points considered during the emergency containment pipes were fire 

(that were broken), and communications of sea compounders19.

On 13/02/2015, it was reported to the ANP that the analysis conducted by the personnel 

hired by Petrobras and BW showed that there was no structural risk of the unit, although there 

is flooding of about 15 meters of water pumps inside the house.

This flooding made it 

impossible to rescue missing for an extended period after the accident, the last body only 

Contextualization - The FPSO Cidade de São Mateus 

 The FPSO Cidade de São Mateus (FPSO CDSM) is a floating production, processing, 

storage and transfer of oil unit.

On the date of the accident, its main production was natural 

gas not associated21, with no oil wells connected to the platform.

The processing of this gas in 

the platform, a liquid fraction was produced:-condensed natural gas liquid obtained in the 

process of the normal field separator, which is kept in a liquid state under pressure conditions 

and separation temperature22.

The gas after processing was all cross docking for the pipeline, 

connected to the unit Cacimbas Gas Treatment (located on land).

The condensate sometimes 

was exported by the gas by pipeline, but most of the time while in production, the condensate 

was stored in deck cargo tanks for further export by tanker.

The unit was operating at a water depth of 792 meters and was located in the Espírito 

Santo Basin, for production of Camarupim and Camarupim Norte fields, as illustrated in 

Figure 34 below.

 FPSO CDSM Processing Plant Features 

The FPSO CDSM processing plant has a gas processing system and an oil processing 

       The gas processing system receives the manifold gas collected from the non-associated 

gas wells (i.e., gas that is not associated with oil).

The gas then passes through a series of 

separator vessels in order to separate the lighter portion of the gas from its heaviest part: the 

The gas flow then moves to a dehydration module for removing all the water and 

only then to follow a compression module that provides the necessary energy to that gas to be 

sent by pipeline to a processing unit on earth.

       The condensed material, segregated after the lighter fraction of the gas oil would be sent 

to the processing system.

If there was no production of oil, only after the gas compression 

module could be injected into the condensate to be exported from the gas in the pipeline.

       The oil processing system of another manifold receive the collected oil from oil wells.

This system was designed with separator vessels and heat exchangers enough to separate oil, 

At the end of this system, oil - free gas and water - would be sent for storage 

on deck cargo tanks, where only go out when there was an offloading operation, ie when there 

was a pumpeamento this content to a tanker by through a flexible hose existing on the 

This oil processing system was designed to receive the condensate stream from 

the gas processing system and process it with the oil before sending to storage tanks.

According to the specifications of the project, when there was no production of oil, this 

condensate would not be sent to this oil-processing system - and yes forwarded directly to the 

pipeline, to be exported by the gas.

3.2.2 Características do systema de armazenamento 

The storage system of the FPSO CDSM has 33 (thirty-three) tanks, and seven (7) cargo 

tanks for storage of produced fluids.

The main information about the tanks are listed in Table 

Table 3 – Cargo handling system tanks 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

Slop dirty (P) 

From these seven tanks, five (2C to 6C) would be used primarily for the liquid product 

storage ready for sending to the tanker (export), and the slop tanks to be used to temporarily 

store and especially dirty water with oily waste, previously its treatment for disposal within 

the environmentally permissible limits.

In turn, the technical specification made by Petrobras 

to hire the FPSO CDSM provided that the produced condensate could be designed in two 

ways in the unit28:  

1) In case of oil production, the condensate is separated from the gas, and then sent to the 

inlet of the oil processing system; 

2) If there is no production of oil, condensed material would be separated from the 

natural gas, and later, after dehydration, condensate would pumpeado within the 

pipeline export gas for subsequent separation of the UTG Cacimbas.

At the time it was the setting that the unit would be installed in Camarupim and 

Camarupim North gas field, Petrobras questioned the Prosafe in 2007 the oil processing 

system was able to stabilize the condensate in pure form for subsequent storage in cargo 

tanks, without the production of oil.

This configuration was different from the two options 

specified for the drive, according to the questioning, to accomplish this it would be necessary 

to stabilize the thermodynamic parameter "Reid Vapor Pressure" (PVR) did not exceed 10 

psia at 37.8 ° C.

The company Prosafe assessed the question of Petrobras, carries out computer 

simulations of the process with the data obtained with Petrobras and in August 2008 reported 

that the condensate would be stabilized in simulated conditions (PVR less than 10 psia) and 

can be stored in tanks for later unloading (offloading) for tankers.

However, it said in the

document that this assessment was for the initial periods29 and it was recommended that the 

export of the condensate was performed by pipeline.

Whereas the unit operated for 1964 days since the beginning of activities in the field 

(already excluding the 24 days he spent in shutdown), the unit exported condensate through 

pumpeio in the pipeline (second choice of the technical description of the vessel) over only 

187 days, with condensate stored in cargo tanks during the remaining days of operation.

The condensate flow produced by the plant was made by tankers using flexible hose 

(hoses) 20 "diameter and a length of 235 meters, and the use of their charge pumps (three), 

Since the start of production, offloading sixteen were made, the last of which was held in 

April 201431.

The seventeenth offloading was scheduled in October 2014 to take place 

between 15 and 19 December 201432, but due to a problem in a built-in flow meter calibration, 

this activity has been rescheduled for February 2015.

At the time of the incident the unit 

stored about 70.000 cubic meters of condensate material33.

3.2.3 Features of condensed material produced  

     After the accident, Petrobras collected and analyzed condensate samples from three storage 

tanks (tanks 2C, 3C and 5C) of the FPSO CDSM.

     The results of distillation tests, density and vapor pressure, carried out by the laboratories 

of the Petrobras Research Center, were sent to ANP and evaluated by your server Center for 

Research and Analysis Technology (CPT).

It was verified that the condensate in question 

consists of a mixture with a predominance of gasoline (naphtha) compounds and minor 

proportions of compatible Light Kerosene or diesel.

29 It is understood that this study was conducted due to forecast delays in interconnection of the pipeline.

     The gaseous fraction of the samples, in turn, is made up of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), 

mainly, and to a lesser extent, natural gas (light naphtha) and natural gas (ethane).

Furthermore, the vapor pressure (PVR) average of the sample collected in the tanks of the 

FPSO CDSM was 57.3 kPa (about 8.3 psia).

Gases that come off oils are unstable gases heavier than air and is therefore difficult to 

disperse.

Consequently, the risk of explosion is greater.

To prevent gas to be detached during 

transport and storage, the specification for vapor pressure is usually specified for PVR 10 to 

12 psia.

      To meet PVR specification, the gas dissolved in the crude oil must be removed, and such 

removal called stabilization.

The crude oil can be stabilized by passing it separators in series, 

where the volatile components are vaporized.

The stabilization of crude oil often requires the 

addition of heat in certain points of the processing train.

3.2.4  Layout of FPSO Cidade de São Mateus 

The FPSO Cidade de São Mateus process plant consisted of modules whose layout is 

shown in top view in Figure 35, removal of the Safety Case of the unit.

        As of May 2011, changes were initiated in operational safety management system affect 

the FPSO CDSM, and the company BW Offshore (BW) began to introduce the practices of its 

management model.

According to interlocutors of BW for action fiscalização, migration 

practices was made considering that corporate and operational procedures applicable to FPSO 

CDSM initially remain being those in force when the Prosafe was still the operator of the 

installation.

Over time, each procedure gradually, it would be assessed by the BW team to a 

finding of its applicability and / or the review needs to be displayed, updated and compatible 

with BW management system.

       Thus, according to the assessment of each procedure, they would be migrated to the 

document control system BW (Management System - MS) or excluded from the company's 

current documentation system.

       The process of migration procedures described above was initiated in 2011 and was used 

initially a criterion that if a procedure had not been accessed in the last two years, this would 

be extinguished.

Responsibility was given to the personnel on board the FPSO Cidade de São 

Mateus do the evaluation, having been shown that: (i) was not managed by a change 

management process; (ii) has not established a timetable for implementation of this migration; 

(iii) the operational management of the office staff of the FPSO CDSM did not participate 

actively in the process of reviewing the procedures, and that task was left to the edge of the 

FPSO CDSM personnel; and (iv) no prioritization was not established for the implementation 

of such migration, for example, priority complete unit of critical procedures.

       Thus, it was observed that: 

(i) The change management procedure in force on the day of the accident34  did not 

include in its scope changes in procedures, only changes in the unit, in equipment, 

(ii) There was the definition of critical procedures for the FPSO Cidade de São Mateus, 

due to non-completion of the procedures migration process initiated in 2011.

It should be noted that in 2012, the internal audit BW had already flagged the need to 

update all operational procedures as described in the internal audit report in 201235:

Petrobras claimed throughout the research process that there was no change of the site 

operator, but only a change of ownership of the company Prosafe38, maintaining the legal 

relationship established with Petrobras.

As mentioned in the text, it was found several 

changes in procedures of the management system, which were readequados to BW 

management requirements, which interfere with the operational safety management FPSO 

CDSM, focus of the ANP Resolution No.

These changes were found previously by 

the ANP and the change of the operator regarding the FPSO CDSM was made official at the

BW Offshore and the hazard management structure of FPSO CDSM 

According to the company's own website39, BW Offshore (BW) is the second largest 

charter company with offices in major oil-producing areas around the world such as Europe, 

Asia, Africa and the Americas (USA and Brazil).

It has a fleet of fourteen FPSOs and an FSO

and operates two other FPSOs.

Its holding company, BW Group, was established in Bermuda 

in 2003 after the restructuring of the company.

BW calls itself as the pioneer for being the first to operate an FPSO for GLP in Angola 

and have converted and installed the first FSO in the Arctic circle, and in 2007 have converted 

the largest FPSO in processing capacity, largest in-depth water already installed and the first 

unit of this type installed in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Cascade field, Petrobras40.

In Brazil, BMW has an organizational structure focused on operating its five platforms.

The Operational Security theme of platforms operated in Brazil was reporting directly to the 

vice president for health, safety, environment and quality (HSEQ VP) which is sold abroad in 

Singapore.

      In its organizational structure in Brazil, BMW has an engineer to comply with 

legislation41 which was directly subordinated to the general manager in Brazil, but reported to 

the vice president for health, safety, environment and quality.

The law enforcement engineer 

had among its duties assist offshore units operating managers to ensure compliance with 

Brazilian regulatory requirements, including the requirements of the ANP, without any 

hierarchical level on the operation of the unit.

     Inside the organizational structure, BW platforms operations managers in Brazil were 

subordinated directly to the General Manager.

In his staff, the general manager still had a 

supply manager, a senior systems administrator, a vice president of finance, a manager of 

human resources, a business manager, legal counsel and vice president of design 

modifications (Brazil).

      The technical dependence of the local BW team in respect of the technical teams abroad to 

the operations of the platforms in Brazil was blatant.

There was BW team's technical 

autonomy in Brazil in relation to various topics related to operational safety, such as change 

management, document control, issuing drawings updates, translations of documents and 

accident investigation.

       It caught the attention of ANP research team the absence of engineering support structure 

and local security to support the operation in BW structure in Brazil.

During inspection 

conducted by ANP in the BW office, was very common the need of the local staff use 

fonoconferências with the office of the BW in Singapore for clarification related to the design 

and operating parameters.

     The operation of the FPSO CDSM was managed in an office BW in Vitória (ES).

This 

office was crowded: a maintenance engineer, safety engineer, a medical officer, two buyers, 

one administrative assistant, one human resources assistant, an assistant personnel logistics 

A safety technician was hired shortly before the accident and have the 

function to support the adequacy of the procedures to BW management practices.

Hazardous identification, safaty studies, analysis and hazard management of 

FPSO Cidade de São Mateus 

       The structuring of risk management as part of the implementation of an operational safety 

management system, involves the identification of hazards, analysis and installation risk 

management throughout its lifetime.

Required by law in many countries, the Safety Case is a 

document produced by the installation operator to demonstrate that all hazards have been 

identified and assessed risks, demonstrate that the control measures were taken to reduce the 

level of risk to ALARP42, level as well how to describe the company's safety management 

system to ensure that controls are effectively and consistently applied.

      In this sense, it was prepared by Prosafe the Safety Case of the FPSO Cidade de São 

Mateus43, consists of seven sections, as shown in Figure 37, withdrawal of this document: 

42 As low as reasonably practicable, which means a risk value for which the cost involved in its reduction is 

disproportionate to the benefits generated.

During the research process, it was found that BW did not perform the monitoring of the 

implementation of the recommendations arising from the risk analyzes carried out before the 

unit's operation.

It was justified by the representatives of BW of which all recommendations 

had already been identified yet completed the design phase and therefore, would not need to 

      Thus, in order to verify the degree of implementation of the recommendations, the ANP 

called for the close-out reports for each of the recommendations identified in risk analysis, to 

have been submitted, after the audit of the Agency, two kinds of forms, as shown in Figure 39 

and Figure 40, taken from two close-out reports (the figures have been adapted to preserve 

signatures of officials).

Figure 39 - Form with recommendation of the closing date 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

Figure 40 - Form without recommendation of the closing date 

From the analysis of the forms, it can be seen that: 

(i) 

Some of the recommendations were classified as "pending" but it had closing date (date 

closed), demonstrating error in the form (Figure 39); 

(ii) Not all the recommendations had closing date only response record date (date responded), 

which would suggest that were still open (Figure 40) and 

(iii) Some recommendations were addressed to both the operator of the installation and as of 

Petrobras (Figure 39).

Events Identification for the pumps room 

Considering the analysis of quantitative risks, it can be seen that we identified two 

greatest dangers (Major Hazards) relating to house pumps and engine room from the eleven 

listed in the study, namely: fire and explosion of the pumps house and fire and explosion in 

the engine room.

For each of these scenarios, the risk related to exposure of people whose 

results were summarized in 5:10:15 section of the Safety Case of the unit was quantified.

       With specific regard to the fire scenario and explosion in the pumps home quantitative 

studies risk assessment showed that: (i) there is a scaling potential for tanks that are adjacent 

to this environment, as for example, tanks load, slop tanks and fuel tanks, (ii) the likelihood of 

scaling would be greater for the burst scenario than to the fire scenario and (iii) in terms of the 

result, personnel who were present in the pumps house was fatally wounded and that there 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

would be no immediate fatalities for the staff who were in temporary refuge (TR) or on the 

main deck.

        The value obtained for annual average level of risk associated with fire and explosion in 

the scenario pumps house, whereas the normal exposure of persons to that scenery, was 

6,71.10-6, which corresponds to a value below the ALARP region defined as being less than 

Managerial monitoring of the implementation of FPSO CDSM Operational 

Safety Management System 

The managerial monitoring the safe operation of the FPSO CDSM was confused with the 

activities required for the operation.

Among the routine activities of management of BW 

Team operations of Vitória office dealing with operational security issues in the operational 

management of the FPSO CDSM, the following are highlighted: 

(i) Daily Meeting (morning call) between management operations and the personnel on 

board the FPSO CDSM, with the participation of OIM, superintendents, security 

technician and planner; 

(ii) Monthly meeting in the Vitória office, with the participation of OIM and the staff of 

the FPSO CDSM operations management, video or fonoconferência; 

(iii) Weekly meeting with Petrobras with the participation of the Operations Manager of 

BW and the Sector Manager of Petrobras.

This type of assembly began in 2014; 

(iv) Monitoring Operational Meeting (ROA), with monthly frequency and participation of 

the operations management of the FPSO CDSM (BW) and sectoral management and 

(v) Quarterly meeting of BW Brazil, held in the office of Rio de Janeiro; and 

(vi) Critical Analysis Meeting (RAC) of SMS, with six-monthly frequency and with the 

participation of BW Operational Management, the Sector Manager and the General 

Manager of Petrobras Organizational Unit in the Espírito Santo Spirit (OU-ES), both 

Monitoring of more specific situations, such as planning for correcting problems in the 

cargo transfer system, indicated in item 6.7 of this report, was made in internal meetings of 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

Petrobras has followed the progress of corrective actions by schedule assessment of 

corrective actions in meetings between BW and Petrobras.

A weekly meeting between BW 

and Petrobras was created in 2014 and this meeting was weekly monitored the progress of 

corrective actions of maintenance of the load transfer system valves.

Petrobras, in addition to the weekly meeting, there was the daily meeting 

videoconference with Petrobras' Fiscal aboard the FPSO CDSM to monitor the fulfillment of 

contracts with the site operator.

It is emphasized that Petrobras performed the monitoring of indicators monthly and 

interpreted the follow-up of ANP Resolution No.

Monitoring the 

implementation of SGSO it was done by examining the internal audit reports conducted by 

BW and monitoring the implementation of the action plan58.

When considering the results of the internal meetings of BMW presented by the 

company, it appears that the annual assessment of the management system implemented in the 

FPSO CDSM was the staff position on board the unit.

This review only described the flaws 

and there was no specific monitoring indicators.

In turn, the monthly follow-up pertaining to 

the safety indicators was manager responsible for operations, maintenance and human 

resources, among which are: (i) injuries with lost time, (ii) number of high potential for 

accidents, (iii ) gas leaks number, (iv) number of fires, (v) number of lifting incidents, (vi) 

number of object falling incident, (vii) number of security notes, (viii) delays in maintenance 

critical equipment, (ix) board leaks number, (x) number of unplanned emissions, (xi) number 

of management changes postponed priority 1 and (xii) staff turnover on board.

         It was observed that over the years some indicators showed performance fall short of the 

target set, however it was not possible to identify specific corrective action for poor 

When asked about the review of the management of BW these indicators, 

Petrobras transferred to ANP documentation BW Offshore where you can not show that this 

fact critical analysis occurred.

When evaluating the monthly follow-up meetings made between Petrobras and BW, it is 

observed that during the year 2014 there was an improvement in monitoring questions related 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

to operational security, but the follow-up of FPSO CDSM indicators was still in its infancy, 

without contemplating the indicators defined by BW for monitoring the operational safety59.

In the meeting minutes were not reported or evidenced corrective actions for situations 

considered inadequate.

The latest monthly meeting between Petrobras and BW before the 

accident, Petrobras management requested to be included with Resolution ANP service index 

indicators No.

43/2007 (SGSO), which includes the actions mapped in risk analysis and 

equipment inspections recommendations.

       During the investigation conducted by the ANP, several failures of evidence were 

identified in implementing the Operational Safety Management System for the FPSO CDSM, 

namely: (i) lack of monitoring the implementation of safeguards and recommendations of risk 

studies; (ii) lack of periodic risk review; (iii) changes in procedures, people and systems 

without the change management process; (iv) lack of training in operational procedures; (v) 

failure to implement operating procedures; (vi) failure monitoring and continuous 

improvement, among others.

       Petrobras planned to hold SGSO audits in chartered platforms, which included an audit 

on the FPSO CDSM in 2015, which did not occur.

We began to evaluate one of the other 

monitoring mechanisms and continuous improvement, auditing SGSO.

Internal Audits Diligences as per ANP Resolution No.

Since the beginning of its operation it was conducted two internal audits of SGSO the 

FPSO CDSM in 2012 and 2014.

       The 2012 audit pointed out ten non-compliances as follows: 

"1- Head of Department did not have access to the Safety Case and its action plan; 

7 (..) All procedures related to operations (ie starting equipment, equipment failure, 

system insulation).

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

       During the investigation there was evidence found from these non-conformities still to be 

present, i.e.

the operations manager had no access to the action plan arising from the 

recommendations of the Safety Case and operational procedures needed to be updated.

        In the last internal audit at the FPSO Cidade de São Mateus, held on 23.10.2014, all non-

conformities were registered in the internal control system called Synergi.

compliance was spun off in the objective evidence and, in turn, was registered as "actions" to 

be monitored through the system.

For each registered share, the period of 18.02.2015 for 

completion was set.

         Thus, from the Internal Audit report, it was opened 29 (twenty nine) shares to follow in 

Synergi, which at the time of internal audit, fourteen were classified as "Implementing" and 

fifteen with status "completed".

          Regarding actions with status "Implementing", it was found that some had already been 

completed, but their status was not updated in the system and the evidence sanitation were not 

recorded, demonstrating a lack of structure in monitoring and updating about information 

preventive / corrective actions.

          Among the actions that were still classified as "Implementing" two deserve special 

mention, namely: 

"Action 17: It was not possible to show the management of the documents 

in BW Offshore system, among the list of FPSO CDSM procedures, 

identification of procedures which are Operational Safety named as critical, 

as described in the Safety Case 384-HS-0501-RPT -015 Rev.0, of 12/12/08, 

item 6.4 Safety Critical Tasks".

 "Action 18: It was filed the records of Implementation Manual Safety Case 

0 of 12/12/08 referring to the unity of risk analysis which is outdated, 

according to the five-year review ".

       Regarding the action number 17 as the migration process procedures of Prosafe for BW, 

although started in 2011, had not yet been completed, critics procedures for the FPSO CDSM 

had not been identified.

Thus, to purify unidentified compliance in internal audit remained 

pending the completion of the migration procedures for the Setup Operator documentation 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

    In regard to action 18, it was settled a review schedule of the Safety Case, having 

started the schetch of the safety studies, named HAZID (completed in October 2014) and 

HAZOP Unit topside (completed in November 2014).

This review began in October 2014 and 

it took twenty weeks for completion.

    Regarding the fifteen actions with the status of "completed", it was observed that twelve of 

them, the actions taken were only off towards providing treatment to objective evidence, 

without having been taken comprehensive and preventive measure to avoid recurrence as 

pointed deviation in non-compliance.

This, in line with the understanding shown by the 

representatives of BW ground crew during the presentation of sanitation of non compliances 

as demonstrated by the lack of understanding of the purpose of the Technical Regulations of 

the Operational Safety Management System (SGSO) ANP establishing the need to take 

corrective action to eliminate the cause of non-compliances identified and preventive actions 

to eliminate the cause of non-conformities in order to prevent the occurrence.

Moreover, this 

fact reinforces the perpetuation of a practice already observed in the audit of 2012 of which 

did not result in corrective actions in order to eliminate the cause of the identified non-

compliances.

     In addition, the BW published a guideline for all the company's fleet in the country in view 

of SGSO audits to include the closing of nonconformities from previous audits.

If for any 

reason the corrective action was not completed in the audit, it would be reopened in the BW 

system and appropriate remedial actions would be defined.

Aside from the stripping pump, the pumps room gathered three cargo pumps (tag 

33PA001A /B/C), both produced water pumps (tag 33PA002A/B) and the two platform 

The cargo and ballast pumps were driven by steam 

turbines, located in the engine room.

Unlike the pumps of cargo and ballast, the stripping pump was driven by steam 

supplied directly to the pump through the steam line coming from the engine room.

The main electrical equipment installed in the pumps were: lighting, emergency lighting, 

audible alarm, light alarm, telephone, two video cameras and gas detectors.

As for the electrical classification area, the pumps room was classified as Zone 164.

The 

area classification drawing tells how the reference standard for its preparation to API RP 505

standard65, which states that this type of area classified ignitable concentrations of flammable 

gases and vapors can often exist or occasionally, due to operational conditions, repair or 

maintenance, breakdown or failure of equipment or due to the communication area with an 

area Zone 0, in which ignitable concentrations of flammable gases and vapors are present 

continuously or for long periods.

The standard indicates that the Standard Classification Zone 

1 includes locations where volatile flammable liquids or liquefied flammable gases are cross 

dockingidos from one container to another, pumps inadequately ventilated rooms for 

flammable gas or for volatile flammable liquids, among others.

The cargo tanks and slop 

storage tanks were classified as Zone 0.

Figure 52 below, extracted from API RP 505 illustrates the area of typical rating for 

It can see that the pumps house is typically classified as zone 1, and that the pumps in 

this area are driven by motor located outside the same.

Figure 52 - Typical Area Classification for FPSOs as per API RP 505 

       The area classification is focused on the selection, design and installation of electrical 

equipment as suitable for environments where it can potentially accrue explosive atmosphere 

material.

       According to IEC 6007966, which establishes the requirements for electrical equipment in 

explosive atmospheres where electrical equipment is installed in areas in which explosive 

concentrations and quantities of flammable gases or dust may be present in the atmosphere, 

protective measures are applied to reduce the likelihood of explosion due to ignition by 

electrical arcs, sparks or hot surfaces, produced by both normal operation or under specified 

fault conditions of own electrical equipment.

       Thus, still according to IEC 60079, the electrical equipment installed in hazardous areas 

must be certified as containing one of the protection types defined in this standard to meet the 

security levels appropriate to each area.

Monitoring, controll and cross docking load system operation 

The control and monitoring of the plant were carried out through a kind of HMI 

(Human Machine Interface), as part of the supervisory system load cross docking system.

The charge transfer system was monitored from the marine control room (CCRM), 

which was located on the houses adjoining the process plant control room (CCR).

The main 

screen of the HMI in CCRM was a juxtaposition of diagrams (P & ID) of the charge transfer 

between tanks system (previously shown in Figure 41 and Figure 42) and is illustrated in the 

following figure.

                                  Figure 54 - IHM screen of the Supervisory System in the CCRM 

The operation of the charge transfer system was conducted by marine operator (operator 

position), supervised by marine superintendent, who reported directly.

In total, there were 

four marine operators in the FPSO CDSM, two expatriates and two Brazilian nationals.

shipment worked a double, consisting of an expatriate and a Brazilian.

Although they occupy the same position, there was a hierarchy among the expatriate 

marine operator and the Brazilian, in which the Brazilian played mainly only functions related 

to the issuance of documents, while expatriates played operational functions.

The difference 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

between people functions occupying the same position was due to the fact that expatriates 

marine operators were more experienced than those Brazilians.68.

In other units, the marine operator can be called a marine operator/ballast or craft 

operator.

In the meantime as much of the load cross docking system valves were controlled through the 

supervisory system in CCRM the marine operator, some valves were controlled by hand controls in 

the upper deck and on the first floor inside the pumps room70.

The local operation of valves was performed by the pump operator (pump man), to 

receive specific order of marine operator.

The valves of the fluid handling system driven off 

the HMI, some automatically sent to the CCR status information of its position (open or 

closed) and others may not.

For these, the marine operator must enter the valve position information after clicking 

on the screen on top of the valve.

All valves OP, OT and OD of interest to this report were 

hydraulically operated valves, while the BFV valves were manually operated.

The Table 8 as below identifies the location of where it was thrown each considered 

important valve for such report.

For valves with command type "Open/Close", the opening 

operation or closing a valve was performed through the HMI in CCRM by clicking on the 

valve and choosing the "open" or "close".

For valves with type "Setpoint"of command, the operation was made in HMI through 

the valve opening percentage setting.

"Toggle" means that the valve position status was 

switched manually by the operator in marine HMI, and not automatically.

The pump supply vapor stripping was done by means of a vapor pipe with admission 

to the home pumps, controlled by a manual valve located in the engine room.

The vapor 

supply was the responsibility of the engine room personnel (engine room) and if there was 

need to operate the stripping pump, the navy personnel requested the opening of the vapor 

The operation of the stripping pump was controlled by opening and closing a power 

vapor control valve pump, located at the home of pumps.

This enabled the adjustment valve 

opening percentage between 00 and 100%.

The pump's operating manual indicated the holding of local actions to be performed 

during starting operation or pump failure, but there was no formal documented procedure for 

pump operation.

As testimonies collected, these transactions were carried out as follows: 

• The pump operator should be next to the pump in order to perform specific actions 

drainage during the match as well as to monitor and report the condition of the equipment for 

the marine radio operator.

• For starting the pump, the marine operator warned the staff of the engine room to 

provide vapor.

Within the pumps room, the pump operator when maneuvering the drain 

valves of the pump the water in the system was expelled and waiting for heating the pump.

The pump operator communicated during this period with the marine operator via radio.

During drainage and heating pump, the marine operator kept the vapor control valve pumps 

slightly open house, worth about 5%.

• After heating the pump, the pump operator visually accompanied the beginning of 

the movement of the machine's pistons, next to the stripping pump.

The pump began to show 

its motion when the opening of the vapor control valve was adjusted to between 7% and 10%.

With the information coming from the pump operator that the pump operating normally, then 

the marine operator used to gradually increase the opening of the vapor control valve to a 

value between approximately 30% and 35%.

• The pump stop was conducted by the speed reduction, then the following actions in 

order: closing the suction line valve to prevent reverse flow, full stop of the pump by 

adjusting the opening of the vapor control valve to 0%, warning the control room of the house

ward which it was stopping machines drainage operation, the pump operator on-site 

confirmation of the fact that pump stopped and closing the discharge line valves.

If there was 

a change in the discharge line first opened up new alignment of the valves, valve opening was 

confirmed locally, the discharge pressure was monitored and finally the previous alignment 

Such practice, however, was not formalized in any operating procedure and dependent on 

the experience and knowledge of marine operator.

The Figure 63 below illustrates the pump control scheme, detached from the data sheet.

Figure 64 shows the screen on which the marine operator commanded the vapor control valve

In the meantime the pump operator was in the pumps room, he had the access to the 

vapor pressure information, pump suction pressure and offload pressure of the pump through 

local indicators, as shown in Figure 65.

Figure 65 - Pressure Gauges vapor, suction and offload stripping pump at the pumps room 

      The information available in CCRM for marine operator were: (i) the percentage of 

opening of the vapor control valve, (ii) suction pressure and (iii) the offload pressure.

The 

stripping pump was endowed with by minute strokes counter (strokes / min) as its datasheet, 

and had the foresight to display the amount of strokes per minute (strokes / min) of the 

stripping pump on screen HMI, but this information was not available to the marine operator.

       In regard to the monitoring offload pressure, there are records of such pressure to reache a 

value of 4.4 bars at a 30% opening of the vapor control valve.

Additionally, there is 

instruction register72 for the marine operator to reduce the opening of the control valve or 

even shut down the pump if the offload pressure reached 5 bars.

     Thus, it can be concluded that the failure to implement safeguards and recommendations identified 

in the analysis of risks associated with the lack of real control status of the implementation of actions 

during the unit operation stage took the platform to a risk condition uncontrolled and above all 

acceptance criteria that could be considered as a good practice.

Such behavior is basic and catastrophic 

failure regarding minimum practices in risk management, and contributes to the degradation of the 

operational safety of the FPSO CDSM.

Flaws in the systems commissioning wise 

      On 17/10/2009, while the operation in FPSO CDSM was still held by Prosafe Company, was 

issued a Change Management form74 of Cargo & Ballast control system (Full Commissioning).

The description of the problem addressed by the change management description that the control 

system of the charging system and ballast is commissioned partially left in the conversion phase, there 

is a need to complete such a commissioning.

It was also recorded that such a system has not been 

completed in Singapore because its completion would take place only after the arrival of unit in Brazil.

As justification and benefit of change management was written System not yet commissioned, No 

control in the CCR (system not yet commissioned, with no CCR control).

Additionally, it was reported that the control system configuration was not checked during the 

installation phase and the actions to be taken to complete the commissioning of the load control 

system and ballast were postponed because they were not considered priority75 in view of achieving to 

obtain the first gas operation, even with the technical unit in a position to carry out such activities.

out from the service list two examples of interest to this incident investigation process items 3:12: 

"03 controls and pressure transmitter of stripping pump yet to be

"12-some valves were not properly commissioned." 

During the investigation, it became clear that for item 03 there was an incomplete commissioning 

and, for item 12, the commissioning was done in the wrong way.

Regarding item 12, the main valve OT-022 6C tank (control valve remotely operated under P & 

ID) was commissioned as fully open or closed position indicator and yet to be commissioned valve.

Nonetheless, a designed project document76 indicated that the OT-022 valve should have control 

position.

Regarding item 3, about the stripping pump controls, there is in one of the annexes of the finished 

work scope form77 confirming that no leak was found in the measuring lines of suction and discharge 

pressures of the stripping pump and such information were available at the IHM.

However, regarding 

the strokes count information was reviewed by instrumentation supervisor that the engineering team

028 (tank 2C), all similar to OT-022 em t in terms of access to the storage tanks are valves that had 

control position.

It is worth mentioning that there is record80 with the information that the logic implemented for 

the OT-022 valve was the local drive only and that there was need for the valve to be operated 

remotely in the same way that all other valves of the cargo tanks, because otherwise, during operations 

load would no control over the 6C tank: 

“Please note this valves needs to be remote operated like all the other cargo tank 

valves, otherwise during cargo operations we will not have any control over tank 

However, it is noted, the screen HMI with representation of the feedback from the OT-022 valve

Below are listed the records of marine operator on 

the reliability issues of the cargo handling system of FPSO CDSM: 

 In 21/08/14, it was recorded that although the OP-valve 051 was fully opened at the site in 

 In 25/09/14, the water pump produced PWP B could not be stopped from the CCRM panel.

 In 30/09/2014, It was recorded for the 4C tank that OT-018 indicated valve opening 10% in 

CCRM though it was 100% closed and the OT-016 indicated valve closed in CCRM though it 

 In 18/10/2014, the OT-019 valve remained 17% open when commanded to close while the 

OT-006 valve showed 100% opening to be controlled in 88% of opening from CCRM.

 In 27/10/2014, the OD-044 valve was locked in place but appears in green (open valve 

indication) from CCRM.

 In 16/12/2014 the valve indicator OP-054 presented problems.

 In 09/02/2015 it was found that the gauges in the discharge of ballast pumps did not indicate 

the same pressure shown in CCR.

  Valuable to note, therefore, a lack of reliability of the information available on the CCR for 

the marine operator.

Additionally, the dates 13/09/2014, 19/09/2014, 25/09/2014 and 28/09/2014 steam leaks were 

reported as responsible for moving the stripping pump.

The leakage from 25/09/2014 was classified as 

After repairs, the pump was tested on 16/10/2014 and only returned to be used on 23/10/2014.

Degradation of the seat rings over the condensed material 

Other data obtained during the investigation was the report that presents the condensed 

characteristics.

This is obtained for the report "Evaluation of failure in the sealing ring of the tank 

valve" issued in 21/10/201481.

This reports the tests on the seal (seat ring) of the tank valve which 

failed in service, in order to characterize the seal material and assist in the evaluation of the possible 

causes that led to its failure.

        Tests performed in the rubber seal where the failure occurred showed that it was made of 

elastomeric material with absorption characteristics of a Nitrile Rubber (NBR), being a remarkable

fact from its composition with 9.8% of volatile materials.

The report indicates this is a relatively high 

amount of volatile materials which can be associated with the condensate absorbed by the elastomer.

The results presented in this report showed that the seal failed due to the presence of longitudinal 

and transverse cracks caused probably by a chemical attack of the internal fluid to the ring associated 

with operating voltages, generating the loss of system sealing.

Triggered valves enabled for crossing flow even in sealed mode and the resulting 

modification introduced in cross docking load system 

After the start of production of gas and condensate storage in the FPSO CDSM, it was identified 

in December 2011 that some valves of the system allow passage of fluid, even when in closed 

position82.

Such a situation initially causes operational problems because the product stored in the 

tanks, initially with low water content and ready to export was contaminated with water, then, leaving 

specification.

Thus, new measures were needed to return the condensate to the initial specification of 

After identifying the occurrence opened a change request on 10/12/2011 by the staff on board of 

FPSO CDSM (MOC-CSM-069)83, with priority 2 (operational impact), for manual valves were 

installed on the system, to allow insulation between double lock slop tanks and the load.

On this 

occasion, it had been identified to occur starboard slop tank contents move to the 2C tank and passing 

the port slop tank contents into the tank 6C, even with the valves of closed tanks.

The change request for the installation of five manual valves (on the suction of the slop tanks, and 

between the port slop tank and 6C tank) was approved by the Operations Manager in February 2012 

and evaluated by the engineering sector of BW Offshore.

The valves were purchased in 09/10/201284 

and embedded in the unit, but by the time of the accident it had not been installed, as shown in Figure

Parallel to the application open installation manual valves, in December 2012 was recorded new 

request for change (MOC-CSM-91)85 on-board staff, with priority 1 (direct impact on safety and 

production), which indicated that 2C tanks, 3C, 4C and 5C had suspected problems in passing in its 

valves and their Dresser couplings - elastic joint that allows the union of plain end pipes, eliminating 

flange, welding or thread and absorbs vibration, small axial and angular movements.

This problem led 

to the migration of content between the tanks.

According to the deck design, the liquid products 

produced to be stored in the cargo tanks from the production could be designed to 2C and 3C tanks 

and then to the other through the use of headers at the bottom of the tanks.

However, since it was 

necessary to enter 2C and 3C tanks to carry out the necessary maintenance, there was a need to 

allocate production to another tank.

       Thus, this request was so that production could be allocated to 6C tank using an inert gas drying 

line was not in use on the main deck of the platform and other adaptations.

Valuable to note the 

change of plan considered to export condensate produced directly by the gas export line, without 

storing it.

The alignment of production to the 6C tank will be left prepared in case of a problem in the 

direct export of condensate by pipeline.

However, the inert gas line would be used to transfer the 

contents (remaining after offloading) of 2C to 5C tanks to 6C tank, with the aid of submersible pumps 

and portable stripping pump.

This insulation was considered necessary because there was a possibility from the 

condensate to migrate to the slop tank P (port) by the problems presented by the storage system valves.

      The use of inert drying gas line located on the main deck to achieve the complete emptying of the 

tanks instead of using the collectors (headers) at the bottom of the tanks was due to the problem of 

passage in the valves installed in the headers.

Besides inert gas drying line, temporary alignment was 

made of submersible pumps inside the tanks, manual valves and hoses flexíveis3.

These valves have 

their sealing seals (seat rings) exchanged in order to solve this problem of sealing.

       It is emphasized that the description of the change management MOC-CSM-91 had an indication 

that the effectiveness of this temporary change was to allow the entry of people in cargo tanks so that 

the necessary maintenance to be made, namely: exchange of shaft seals (seat rings) of internal and 

external valves to the tanks and repair of Dresser couplings.

by the personnel on board the FPSO CDSM and approved for further study by the Operations Manager 

in December 2012 and approved for implementation in February 2013.

        As indicated by the MOC-CSM-091, while the repairs of the valves of tanks 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C and 

slop port were made, direct export of condensate through the pipeline, would be taken together with 

the natural gas.

This procedure, referred to in unit design, used three pumps located on the main deck, 

which were designed from the beginning of the FPSO for such service86.

If any difficulties were encountered during the service inside the tanks, there would be a line 

ready to move production directly to 6C tank with the aid of a temporary alignment.

This alignment 

was provided with the installation of pipe sections, valves and mechanical insulation, on the main

For emptying the port slop tank, would be used to pump stripping with alignment with OP-038, 

located in-line separate from the headers that contain faulty valves.

In order to prevent a counter flow during the use of the stripping pump, or prevent the contents of 

the tank port slop tanks were to 2C to 5C87, It was installed a check valve (check valve) in the 

temporary line (inert gas drying line).

In the check valve, a manual valve in the temporary alignment 

was inserted, which prevented the production 6C reached the drying tank by the inert gas line.

Then, for emptying the slop tank port to the tank 6C, it was not necessary the use of inert gas

However, there is no task scheduling description, modifications and isolates was registered with 

the MOC-CSM-091 to allow entry into the tanks and slop 6C starboard.

In no other document was the 

description of such planning.

In addition, it is emphasized that the MOC-CSM-091 in fact been issued 

for entry into the slop tanks 6C and starboard.

As nothing was described on the tasks required for 

emptying the tank 6C and slop starboard, it was expected that the emptying of these tanks occur by 

traditional methods, ie through offloading, transfer between tanks by gravity or with the pump job and 

the line own drive system.

In turn, the change request for the installation of manual valves (MOC-CSM-069) was recorded in 

November 2013 that the discovery of aromatic content (BTEX - benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and 

xylenes) in the stored condensed the FPSO CDSM demanded a reassessment of the change of plans so 

that only two valves were installed to allow the separation of slop tanks P (port) and 6C tank and 

prepare for future interventions in cargo tanks.

On this occasion, it was indicated that planning for intervention in the system that had lasted for a long 

time, has been changed so that there was an exchange of shaft seals (seat rings) valve to a more 

resistant polymeric material to chemical attack caused by presence of high levels of condensed 

aromatics in the unit.

    In November 201390 the planning to install two valves was postponed and the first exchanges of 

system valve seals, being followed by a campaign of exchange of valve seals were made.

This 

campaign was initiated by the interior of the pump house, providing the possibility for the board to 

create personal routes for condensate flow and isolate parts of the system, making it possible to 

perform interventions and other regular maintenance activities.

Some of shaft seals (seat rings) are 

replaced shown in Figure 82.

The plan to install manual valves postponement was due to the inability to perform the activity 

without emptying and degas the adjoining tanks in performing the activity.

including the use of positive pressure ventilation generated by the pump house and the use of self-

contained breathing apparatus for the maintenance team.

However, this activity was considered high 

risk and was not approved.

In 04/02/2014, the marine superintendent added to the change of management of content MOC-

CSM-091 that in order to prevent condensate migration to the tanks by headers collectors, the seat 

rings were replaced from the following valves as per Viton Material: OP-070, OP-077, OP-078, OP-

In this case, the marine superintendent also mentioned the difficulty of changing the shaft seals 

(seat rings) of OP-068 valves and BFV-1005 and therefore spades  were installed91 these valves as a 

way of isolating the same.

During the investigation it was shown that the exchange of the seal of OP-068 valve seals was not 

implemented due to the liquid level inside the port side slop tank overcome the valve elevation degree.

In addition, there is sufficient evidence to state that the spades  installed to insulate the OP-068 

valves and BFV-1005 were not appropriate to the service, because in the FPSO CDSM operations had

control failure in the inventory management of spare parts, practice to manufacture racquets on board92 

and lack of foresight in off project for spades  installation in the cargo transfer system 93.

The flange connection in which was installed the spade for the insulation of OP-068 valve was 

condensed leak point in this accident.

During the investigation of the ANP, after the accident, there 

was high risk of removing such a spade in the situation where the FPSO CDSM was.

Thus, the ANP 

did not have access to the spade and the analysis of the piece in question properties will be made as 

soon as made available by the companies involved.

The outlook for business is that the withdrawal of 

the spade occurs when the unit is under cross docking, as the situation has not been scheduled to

Installation issues on spades  in load storage system 

BW had a procedure for the mechanical installation of insulation95.

The procedure requires that 

all mechanical insulation should be documented in Mechanical Insulation Certificate and that all 

insulation certificate should be accompanied by flow charts pipe (P&IDs) with insulating points 

properly indicated.

The insulation field certificate contained in the description / include: (i) requesting, (ii) the work 

permit number associated, (iii) design of the area where the insulation occur; (iv) the equipment to be 

isolated; (vi) insulation of the subject; (vii) the authorization and approval; (viii) insulation medium 

(blind flange, spade, figure 8, etc.) and insulation sequence.

         Another requirement of the procedure was that the process line should be inspected to confirm 

that the P&ID reflected faithfully the physical configuration of the insulation, the modified design 

should be submitted to IOM for approval and, following approval, the P & ID should be forwarded to 

the corrections "as built" (as-built).

In addition, the insulation certificate should always accompanied 

by the respective valid permission.

The mechanical insulation procedure defined four methods not 

approved insulation (via check valve, pressure relief valves, valve "open failure" and control valves) 

and three possible methods of insulation: 

Method 1 as of single and drain block; 

Method 2 as of double and drain block; and 

Method 3 as of positive insulation.

For method 3, positive insulation, it is stated that: 

 "This is the highest standard of insulation, performed by the installation of plates 

or blind flanges or by removing a short section of the pipe and the installation of 

   Specifically on the method 3, the procedure mentions that the following points should be taken into 

consideration while conducting positive insulation:  

(i) 

All the blank flanges and gaskets must be specified for flange class; 

(ii) 

All blank flanges and gaskets are made from material appropriate for the application 

lines with acid products etc.); and 

(iii) 

The thickness of the flange is according to the document: Calculation of Blank flange.

Although there is mention of a document "Flanges Calculation Blind," there was no field work 

permit application or the mechanical insulation certificate that made reference to the need to calculate 

or specify the spade to be installed.

According to testimony, there was no requirement on board the 

FPSO CDSM to the record in the work permit (PT) the defendant's pressure rating for the paddle and 

the executor of the work permit, after approval for execution of the service, should look to pressure 

class pipe to choose the spade or request its manufacture.

       It must be noted that, according testimonials, there were few spades  available for standard flanges

It is noteworthy that there was greater availability of standard spade ANSI (American National 

Standard Institute), which was the most common type of connection to the other drive systems.

     The mechanical insulation procedure considered that the insulation of ballast / cargo tanks it was a 

critical and complex activity.

In this case, an additional permission, specifically for the insulation of 

activities could be considered during the working meeting of risk analysis (JSA - Job Safety Analysis).

      As for the selection of the insulation method to input service cargo tank, was setting the method 3 

(positive insulation) should be adopted for deck lines and Method 2 (double block and bleed) should 

be used for bottom lines of charge transfer system.

As for the length of a mechanical insulation for 

longer time the validity of seven days of a work permit, there were two possibilities: 

(i) To issue new work permit immediately after the expiration of the initial permission and in 

this case, the procedure stated that the insulation certificate could be transferred to the new 

work permit; or 

(ii) To register the mechanical insulation in Long Insulation Control Duration (LTI).

     The Long Last Insulation Control Duration (LTI)97 It had a procedure on requirements in order to 

verify that the insulation were working as insulation certificate, check that locking devices and 

warnings were running in good condition, and to inform the crew about the LTIs.

Repair execution of the storage system valves in the load tanks inlet 

In 2014, after about two years since the first identification of problems in the storage system 

valves, which had fluid passage even when in closed position, the problem had already reached 

advanced level of system degradation, becoming a widespread problem the storage system valves.

Even in this context, it was decided to maintain production while isolating the tanks to entry for 

service.

According to records of the BW, only 6C tank valves had no such problem101.

In April 2014 opened a new change request (MOC-CSM-129), registered as a client request 

(Petrobras) for the exchange of the seals of the valves of the cargo tanks, the pumps and the deck 

house were executed main.

The new seals should be made of other material, Viton (fluorine elastomer) instead of NBR 

(Acrylonitrile Butadiene Rubber) material used in the valve system loads since its construction.

In describing the MOC-CSM-129 change management were identified all valves whose shaft seals 

You can see that this relationship valves were not in the OP-068 valves and 

BFV-1005 pump house or the OD-043 and OD-044 valves of the main deck, which during the 

investigation102 found to have been treated for an oversight.

Such modification was approved for implementation in June 2014.

However, the exchange of 

campaign Stamps storage system valves also began in early 2014 and no further evaluation was done 

within the change management process by security personnel and engineering.

       To implement the plan of insulation tanks, 01.04.2014, the produced condensate began to be 

exported by the natural gas using the pipeline connected to the unit.

On 02/04/2014, the offloading 

was performed, with a consequent reduction of the levels of tanks 2C, 3C, 4C and 5C103.

04/09/2014 and 04/21/2014, the annual shut down for maintenance was carried out, which was not in 

its scope the exchange of sealing valve seals.

     On 08/04/2014, the closed and open drains that were aligned to starboard slop tank, due to the 

insulation port slop tank, they could be returned to normal alignment, i.e., to port slop tank.

On the 

same day moved slop water from starboard to port side slop.

     On 11/08/2014, he started to use the stripping pump to move the water from the starboard slop for 

the slop of port.

In 08.13.2015 started the process of making the slop of free gas starboard (gas 

freeing).

On 09/02/2014 it was announced that the inserting of slop starboard was completed.

     On 26/08/2014 there was a return of production to the tanks, with the condensate export and stop 

before the end of repair of the valves of the tanks 2C to 5C.

It is noted in passing service between 

marine superintendents on 20/08/2014104 mention to customer pressure (Petrobras) and Operations 

Manager (BW) so that production back to be stored in tanks 6C and 2C.

In this same passage service it 

was announced that the port slop tank had problems, with migration of content to 5C, even after the 

renewal of the valves OT-041 and OT-023 port of the slop tank.

Additionally, it was registered in the same passage of service valves and couplings Dresser of 2C 

and 3C tanks had not yet been repaired.

So while the repairs were not completed and problems were 

also identified in the repaired items, it was decided to return to the condensate storage on the ship, 

disregarding the initial planning done to repair the valves before the condensate storage return in cargo 

In 03/09/2014 was recorded test valve 3C of the tank, wherein the valve OT-004 did not respond to 

commands of CCRM or the local command.

Manual pump use was required.

The OT-029 valve would 

not close completely the CCRM, only through the local command.

      On 08/09/2014 the production happened to be directed to the 2C tank and on 11.9.2014 was 

directed to the 3C tank.

     On 13/09/2014 the check valve installed in the inert gas drying line is reversed by setting a 

modification in relation to the MOC-CSM-091.

In the marine superintendent of the Service Form 

November 2014105 was recorded 6C that the tank had to be loaded (condensate production), then the 

line check valve MOC-091 should be inverted.

Since then, the flow direction changed to the opposite 

in inert gas drying line, that is, through the course of the pump house to the cargo tanks, as illustrated 

in Figure 89.

This change to the management MOC-CSM-091 change was made without hazard 

assessment and the overall impact on activities before implementation.

The operation performed on 

this day was the use of stripping pump for transferring the contents of the slop tank port to 3C tank, by 

opening the valve in the OD-043 line run down.

Additionally, it was found that, during and after repair of the valves of the tanks 2C to 5C and 

slop tank port, activities were carried unplanned changes that used in relation to own MOC-CSM-

091106, distorting the originally intended use of the alternative alignment installed.

Figure 89 - Change in the MOC-CSM-091 

Important to note that the demand is maintained to proceed to the emptying port slop tank, valves 

which had been repaired but has problems remained.

Another aspect observed was that for carrying 

out the emptying of the slop tank port was decided to use the inert gas drying line in a direction 

opposite to the planned on MOC-CSM-091 instead of the alignment performed earlier to take the

contents of the slop from port to 6C tank, using a pump stripping, with alignment only by lines and 

valves inside the pump house, as planned in the MOC-CSM-091.

The following day, 14/09/2014, started the inverting process slop tank port.

In 19/09/2014 and 

25/09/2014, there record of the stripping pump was used again to remove contents of the slop tank port 

through the inert gas drying line and opening the valve OD 043 run down the line.

        In late September the stripping pump could not be used due to failure to provide steam.

Only in 

late October 2014, the stripping pump was again used to remove the contents of the slop tank port.

31/10/2014, there was record of a purge of slop tank port and the next day, the tank was measured and 

On 11/03/2014, there was water transfer Registration 6C tank to the slop of port.

In 

the marine superintendent service day pass on 19/11/2014107, it was announced that "try to purge and 

make the slop tank of gas free port, but the OT-037 and OT-040 are giving way and hydrocarbon gas 

entered the port slop tank".

It was also recorded in this same passage service the starboard slop tank 

still needed to seat rings replacement on its valves.

At the end of the transfer 6C water to slop port from the stripping 04/11/2014 pump was used to 

transfer condensate 6C to 2C, using alternate alignment of MOC-CSM-091.

08/11/2014 6C in the tank was reported empty and the stripping operation has ended.

However, the 

day after stripping pump again used for the same operation, ie transferring the condensate to 2C 6C, 

by means of inert gas drying line.

Also on 09.11.2014, the starboard slop tank was emptied with the 

stripping pump and registered as empty.

On 11.12.2104 was recorded early purge the starboard slop 

Therefore, 6C tanks and slop starboard were being emptied, while the MOC-CSM-091 had not 

been issued providing this task.

Even after emptying the tank 6C, on 11.12.2014, no employment record of stripping pump transferring 

contents of the slop tank port to 6C tank.

However, this time we used the alignment inside the pump 

house with the aid of OP-085 valve.

      Only on 21/12/2014 was recorded entering the 4C tank for final inspection and 25/12/2014 5C 

tank returned to store condensate, condensate and received the 2C and 3C tanks.

      In early January the stripping pump was again used to transfer 6C content to 2C by inert gas drying 

line and also to empty the slop tank starboard.

      Besides the new attempt to empty the tank 6C and starboard slop tank started emptying the slop 

tank port, which presented problems as previous service passage reports.

It turns out that with the 

simultaneous deflation of the two slop tanks, the unit needed to direct the drains elsewhere, which was

held on 12/01/2015 for the 4C tank.

This is another change that took place without prior assessment of 

hazards and global impact on activities.

      The contents of the port side slop tank was being directed to the tank 4C using the stripping pump 

and, therefore, it was necessary to use the washing line 4C tank (4C aft COW line).

This alignment 

with COW line with installing insulation to isolate the 4C of other tanks, shown in the following 

figures, is yet another modification that occurred without prior assessment of the dangers and the 

overall impact on the activities, i.e., without using the tool change management.

Figure 90 - Flexible hose connection points between closed drain and 4C aft COW line 

Figure 10 – Insulation of 4C aft COW line 

It was shown that in this period in January, the situation of use of inert gas drying line connected 

to 4C tank as well as the direction from the drain to the 4C tank was as follows.

 As evidenced in audit, on 17/01/2015 it was started this a try operation 6C empty the tank 

through the condensate vaporization.

This shutdown was initiated due to the difficulty to empty the 

tank with the stripping pump.

The objective was to heat the water inside the tank 6C utilizing the 

existing steam line within the tank.

This operation was evidenced by the early 6C tank temperature 

record in office log book to book, which so far contained no temperature record in this tank.

The expected result was that the condensate layer above water was sprayed at about 35 ° C.

Vapors were continuously vented by the vent riser (shown in Figure 94) daily, the day shift, with 

inhibition of gas detectors on the main deck, in the area near the exit of the vapors.

The scheme used 

to blow the gas is shown in Figure 95.

Figure 95 - Simplified scheme condensate vaporization operation 

This task was also not assessed by change management and was not part of MOC-CSM-091 

On the day of the overseer service passage 21/01/2015 this operation were recorded, there 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

was approximately 130m3 condensate, and that the temperature should be maintained at 35 ° C, with 

the recommendation that did not exceed 40 ° C.

Between 20/12/2014 and 31/01/2015, the unit had been no marine superintendent, getting the 

marine operator accumulating its function with the superintendent.

Thus, vaporization operation was 

delivered in progress to other marine operator on 21/01/2015.

       The service crossing report there was mention of the alignment of the drain closed for 4C tank.

flexible hose line between the inert gas drying and other cleaning line (line COW) 4C tank for water 

transfer purposes to 4C tank was also registered in the service passage report has been installed.

However, it was not registered, the reason these alignments, such that the ratio has not been registered 

to have the two slop tanks out of operation.

        Not to mention as listed service crossing report the difficulty of making the slop tank of gas free 

There was an attempt to purge the two slop tanks 

simultaneously, but without success.

It should be noted that in previous service passes, had already 

been registered difficulty in relation to purge the slop tank port.

        In 20/12/2014 was recorded in the service passage that slop tank port was not fixed, to avoid 

using the port side bottom header to transfer load, since the load migrate into the slop tank port.

However, this information was not kept in the day of the service pass 21/01/2015.

         Anyway, on 23/01/2015, there was use of stripping pump to transfer the cargo port of slop to 6C 

On this occasion, the slop tank port was measured with gap (ullage) of 22,09m height, and the 

tank has a height of 30m order of magnitude, i.e.

there was a significant content in this tank.

Therefore 

the slop tank port has already been put into use after two days of service passage.

After repeated unsuccessful attempts to vaporize the condensate tank 6C, in the days 02.05.2015, 

02.09.2015 and 02.10.2015 the stripping pump was used to transfer 6C contents into the slop tank 

           Although there offloading schedule for the month of February and despite all the difficulties 

encountered in a complete draining of 6C tank during the month of January and early February, the 

team on board was still trying to empty the 6C tank on 11/02/2015, date of the accident.

            The only written record in the book of marine department records for the day 02/11/2015 was 

the starting information of stripping pump to 9:50 a.m.

the morning.

Described "early stripping pump 

to drain the header port" (start stripping pump to strip port header).

In depoimento3, drainage was 

reported that this was necessary because of the day before the line have been used to transfer water by 

gravity from the tank to 5C slop tank port, as written in the marine department logbook.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

According to digital information recorded by the supervisory system, on 02.11.2015 the supply of 

steam for stripping pump was started at 09: 00 am, with an opening percentage of the control valve by 

10%, as shown in Figure 96 as follows.

Between 20/12/2014 and 31/01/2015, the unit had been no marine superintendent, leaving the operator.

Also according to the information saved by the supervisory system before the opening of the 

control valve is adjusted to 10%, around 08: 53h, there was alignment of the discharge of stripping 

pump for slop tank port (opening of OP-079 valves and OP-084) and alignment suction pump for 

stripping 6C tank (OP-opening valves 041, PB-050, PB-047 and PB-071).

Remember that this 

alignment for emptying the tank 6C had been tried unsuccessfully in January.

         Thus the content of 6C tank was transferred to the slop tank port during the morning of 

02.11.2015, until 11: 27h, when the suction and discharge were closed (closure of the OP-041 and OP-

84 valves) with the pump still operating, 7% and 8% opening of the steam control valve.

In deposition, it was reported that there exchange header used in the suction port slop tank and 

exchange alignment 2C discharge into the tank.

The new alignment of the suction involved the 

opening of OP-042 valve.

Meaning that the OP-042 valve was operated by pumping outside the 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

marine control room (CCRM), but marine operator informed the supervisory system when the valve 

opening.

There is no record of the opening OP-042 in the supervisory system for the day 11/02/2015.

The new alignment on the discharge pump would use the stripping inert gas drying line.

the alignment of 6C tank discharge into the tank 2C using the inert gas drying line had already been 

tried unsuccessfully in January.

To align the exhaust stream of stripping pump, one of the necessary 

maneuvers was the opening of OP-084 valve for marine operator in CCRM, but there was no record of 

this opening in the supervisory system.

Also, to use inert gas drying line, pumping should open the 

manual valve to the main deck.

In testimony it was reported that at the end of the attempt to empty the tank 6C to the slop tank 

port on 02.10.2015, by identifying loss of efficiency in the transfer, it was thought that there would be 

leakage into the slop tank port for the header port.

It is worth mentioning that on the marine 

superintendent of service crossing report 20/12/2014108 It was reported that if the slop tank port was 

not fixed, then it was necessary to avoid the use of port side bottom header to transfer load, since the 

load migrate into the slop tank port.

However, this information lack of tightness between the slop tank 

port and the port's header was not passed in the service passage occurred in January.

Causal factors and root causes inured by the accident 

To identify causes of the accident, we used the methodology of identification of causal factors 

using fault tree and, subsequently, identifying its root causes using the root causes of map-related 

SGSO requirements, as it presented in the Integrated Operational Safety (SISO) and as indicated 

practice of Guidelines for Investigating Chemical Process Incidents (AIChE, 2003).

Causal factor is any negative occurrence or unwanted condition that would, if eliminated, would 

prevent the occurrence of the incident, or reduce its severity.

In turn, the root cause is the absence, 

negligence or deficiency of management systems that enabled the occurrence of equipment failure / 

systems; and / or determining human errors investigated for the occurrence of the incident.

The event was considered condensate leak followed by explosion in FPSO CDSM the pump house 

that caused the death of nine people twenty-six wounded, seven serious damage to the installation, 

partial flooding and interrupting the production of two production fields indefinitely without damage 

to the environment.

For the accident FPSO Cidade de São Mateus, Figure 97 represents the sequence of causal factors 

identified in this investigation.

For a better understanding of the public not knowing the SGSO, the 

root causes have been reported both in general appearance (proximate causes), as related to SGSO

Causal Factor n° 1: Inadequate storage of the condensed material 

The first causal factor identified by the ANP refers to a change in use of the FPSO CDSM still 

made in the conversion installation design phase.

Initially, the FPSO CDSM only store condensed case 

oil.

However, during project discussions, Petrobras requested the Prosafe to assess whether the 

condensate was stabilized to be stored without being mixed with oil.

By agreeing to this alternative 

without proper risk management introduced by this change, the chain of events began which 

culminated in this accident.

         Despite this, there is another opportunity to correct such deviation, since there was a requirement 

that risks were reviewed at the beginning of the production phase.

This review could not be evidenced 

during this investigation, since the safety studies issued at the design stage were still in force on the 

date of the accident, also considering the initial specification of not stock condensed without being 

mixed with oil.

Hence, it is found that, due to the lack of a change management process before the unit operation and 

lack of risk review at the beginning of unit operation as described in the following sub-items, was 

stocking inadequate condensate on the platform..

Root Cause n°1: [16.3] Management of of Change not performed 

During the bidding phase of Charter Agreements and operation of Services for the FPSO Cidade 

de São Mateus, was drawn 0 revision of the document containing basic design specifications118, 

offered to participants of the bidding companies.

One of the mandatory requirements of this document concerns the allocation of condensate 

1) In case of crude oil, condensate must be separated from natural gas and water, and then sent to 

the oil processing module119; 

2) If there is no oil production, condensate should be separated from the natural gas and water, 

and subsequently directed to the pipeline to export natural gas, for later separation Cacimbas.

It occurs that Petrobras decided to link the platform only Wells Camarupim and Camarupim 

North Campos, both gas producing fields non-associated.

The change occurred caused Petrobras, in 

2007, consult the company responsible for the conversion and engineering design, Prosafe (PRS) on 

the condensate obtained could be stabilized for subsequent storage in their tanks.

Evidenced email 

from Prosafe, in October 2007, in response to Petrobras on adjustment of simulation models for the 

As of June 2008 month of the121 meeting minutes indicates that Prosafe said it would be possible 

to send the condensed to the cargo tanks via M10 (modulo 10, oil processing) for stabilization.

However, this very minute to Prosafe warns that despite the offloading pumps are suitable for 

pumping condensate, the preferential export method is to direct the condensate to the export pipeline.

In August 2008, Petrobras requested the Prosafe that satisfied the impacts on the first gas if it 

were decided to direct the condensate to the separation module / oil treatment 122.

The Prosafe said he 

started the study so that the compositional data and the first well gas production profile were sent.

Prosafe prepared a report123 describing all of Petrobras requests history as well as the technical 

basis for the answers, containing e-mails as an attachment, cases modeled simulation software aid 

procedures and tables containing operating parameters to be followed so that they reach the 

condensate stability in module 10.

This report is evidenced Petrobras' refusal to provide some reports of Prosafe the gas wells to 

support the modeling claiming confidentiality.

One of the conditions laid down in such a way was to reach a condensate stabilization, getting a 

pressure Reid steam, PVR124 of 10 psia to 37,8°C.

Figure 99 - condensate simplified processing route from gas 

Since the beginning of the design of this installation, was the interconnection of this platform 

prediction with the Gas Treatment Unit (GTU) of Cacimbas through a new pipeline, designed under 

the PLANGAS, a project created to improve the national energy system reliability and anticipate the 

availability of natural gas for thermal power generation.

During the inspection27 it was unclear whether the initial motivation for condensate storage was 

due to a possibility of postponing the operation start of the FPSO CDSM by not installing new 

pipeline Camarupim, or the lack of initial capacity of the Gas Treatment Unit (GTU) of Cacimbas of 

the quantity or characteristics of condensate that would be received.

Nor is it known what caused the change in the initial design of interconnecting oil wells as it could 

have been connected to this platform wells Golfinho Field.

Thus, the platform came through storing condensate, since the platform started production on 

10/06/2009125, three months before the completion of the installation and commissioning of the 

pipeline, on 05/09/2009126.

 During this time there was the commissioning of the compressors when all 

inventory produced gas was taken to the flare for burning and the amount of condensate produced "by-

product" of gas production, was stored in tanks.

Prosafe fact is that the report indicates the understanding that the condensate storage was a 

temporary change, to register that would be in the early years and that there would be a few times 

when the condensate would be exported by pipeline but stored in tanks.

In practice, what would be 

temporary has become an established practice, for the period from June 2009 to July 2015, for a total 

of 1988 days of production by 187 days there were export condensate by pipeline in 1777 days there 

were storage and 24 days were devoted to scheduled production stops.

Between the days when the unit 

exported condensate, 136 days were used for the entry and repair of tanks to correct the problems 

posed by the cargo transfer system valves127.

Despite the above numbers, revision B of the General Technical Description (GTD), issued in 

2013 with the unit already in operation and without ever being connected to any pit oil, makes no 

mention of this change on the condensate storage.

Therefore, we can conclude that it was not issued at the design stage or after FPSO document 

input operation that showed a Change Management process, which would produce practical effects 

such as reassessment of the risks that the facility would be submitted to the store condensate.

About Change Management in the design phase, it is emphasized that there was the identification 

and recognition of the potential impact of the change.

However, the change was not managed by both 

companies - the contractor and the contractor.

Thus, it was observed that the written procedures of 

both companies instruct management on the operational phase - not in the design phase.

A formal process would have required the production of a risk analysis.

As a risk analysis 

study shall be done with a multidisciplinary team, it is possible that someone in this team had pointed 

the possible condensate attack on valves (more precisely, the sealing material of the valves).

About Change Management in the operation phase, it is necessary to report that the staff on 

board often operated with permissions of work for almost daily use of vents of the inert gas system to 

depressurize the tanks.

The pressure increase in cargo tanks was coming from the detached gas 

condensate and for carrying out the activity was needed inhibition of gas detectors topside near these 

This common practice can also be seen in books bypass records.

Still, the flight crew did not 

identify that this could be occurring due to a change in project parameters.

It was evident during the investigation that the improper storage of condensate was known 

both as BW Offshore Petrobras, as it indicates presentation by BW Petrobras Operational Meeting 

Monitoring (ROA) of 01.26.2015.

Figure 100 shows the slide with pain points indicated by BW.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

Figure 100 - BW indication Petrobras that the condensate storage in the FPSO CDSM was done 

improperly 

Another point to note is the discrepancy between the operating parameters of the project and those 

For this they compared the operating parameters recorded for each process 

equipment (eg temperature and pressure) on the record sheets of the operation team with the reported 

parameters in the Operational Configuration Report required for the condensate to reach a lower PVR 

value to 10 psia 37.8 ° C.

      This may indicate a failure in the passage of responsibilities and project personnel information to 

the operating personnel and failure structure for maintaining process parameters within the limits 

previously established.

He drew the attention of the investigation team the absence of engineering 

support structure and local security to support the operation.

Every time the ANP research team 

demanded clarification of design information and operating parameters, BW had to resort to 

conferences with its office in Singapore.

       So, if the risk controls members of the change management process were used, it was expected 

that: (i) the rationale for the change would be recorded; (ii) the implementation of the changes would 

only be made after evaluation of hazards and the global impact on activities; (iii) there would be 

updating the procedures and documentation affected by the change; (iv) take place training and 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

communications to all personnel whose job is impacted and, finally; (v) the authorization for the 

proposed change would be issued by an appropriate management level.

      In this sense, it can be seen that neither the operator nor the installation of the Concession Operator 

used their change management procedures.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes Causal 

Factor "inadequate Storage condensate" and contradicts all control procedures set out in item 16.3 of 

Root Cause n° 2: [12.6.4] Lack of hazards review  

The Safety Case developed during the unit's design contains the description of the operational 

scenario as "the hydrocarbon condensate can be injected into the gas export line downstream of the pig 

launcher - this system is only used if the condensate can not be mixed with crude oil due to restrictions 

of high values of Reid vapor pressure128”.

In other words, safety studies carried out during the design 

phase did not consider that there would be pure condensate storage unit in the cargo tanks.

It should be noted that the plant operator the procedure on the preparation and review of Safety 

Case129 It provides a period of updating of security studies from the design phase and operation, during 

which it could have been identified the need for revision of the safety studies.

Although this 

assumption has yet been changed during the design phase, the safety studies have not been updated to 

incorporate this change.

In addition, this procedure requires the Safety Case must go through a cycle of mandatory review 

every five years or in the event of significant change in the unit.

Hereunder, any change that generates 

impact must (i) be identified and reported in accordance with the management system controls or a 

change management procedure or Request Enhancement action and (ii) generate the Safety Case 

Review and their further studies.

        Figure 101 then removed from the procedure, shows the need to update the security studies and 

the Safety Case review.

Figure 101 - Updating safety studies and Safety Case Review 

In the manual are still some examples of specific changes that should trigger changes in the 

Safety Case: design changes and structure of operating parameters and process, maintenance, 

inspection and experiences from testing of safety critical elements (SCEs), changes in installation 

(including SCEs), changes and behavior of the critical elements of security, historical incidents and 

abnormal events, new knowledge and understandings, changes in safety standards and changes in the 

security and management aspects of human factors affecting the facilities.

It is worth noting that the 

document mentioned as a specific example of changes in the Safety Case which would require a 

revision of this document relating to design changes and operational parameters "life due to fatigue 

and corrosion of topside and hull." 

Additionally, the procedure establishes that, in order to determine whether a revision of the safety 

case is required, should be carried HAZID and HAZOP studies based on change areas identified and 

the decision whether or not to revise the Safety Case should be documented.

       In addition to the own forecast update of the Safety Case appear in that BW procedure, it should 

be noted that some standards also indicate the need for risk analysis of the review in certain 

circumstances, as transcripts below:  

"A general risk analysis is only valid as a basis for decision-making as the basis for

with the issuance of the Safety Case was revised in February 2015.

It was reported BW by 

representatives of the HAZOP (first study to be revised as scheduled) would already be finalized, with 

the validation phase for catering teams.

The Safety Case revised, however, it had not been issued to 

date of the accident, although the BW procedure provides that the review of the Safety Case should be

It was observed also that the description of the unit shown in HAZOP drafted in 2007 during the 

detailed design for the charge transfer132 systems contained the following text:

Figure 11 – HAZOP text from the topside (2015) 

The text of the Figure 103 mentions that the condensate storage would be held together with 

crude oil in cargo tanks, which did not represent the actual operation that was practiced in the unit 

(pure condensate storage in cargo tanks).

Although the unit never operated with crude oil, which configured a change assumption that need 

to be evaluated for their impact in cargo transfer system, it was only revised the HAZOP for the unit's 

topside and has not been revised HAZOP for the load transfer system of the FPSO CDSM, which 

found itself outside the scope of the five-year review.

The safety study “CFD Gas Dispersion 

Modeling for Gas Detector Location” and “Fire Propagation and Structural Protection Analysis” also 

not part of the scope of review provided for in the schedule.

Thus, it can be seen that:  

(i) It could not be demonstrated that there was the unity of the Safety Case review at the end of the 

design phase, because there was only one version of the Safety Case 133 issued on February 2009.

If 

such a review had taken place, there was the possibility of identifying significant changes in operating 

assumptions of the FPSO CDSM also decided during the conversion phase; 

(ii) the mandatory cycle of revisions every five years for the Safety Case was not done on time; 

(iii) the revision cycle that was in progress when the time of the accident did not include the review of 

all safety studies that had their premises changed since the last issue.

    In addition, the operator of the concession could have identified the need to update the risk studies, 

as provided for in GTD the need for Petrobras to receive and approve the risk studies and the HAZOP 

developed in the project detailing phase should be updated in the operational phase, as quoted below: 

"17.1 - Both the Risk Assessment Study as the Risk Management Program should 

be submitted to Petrobras for approval.

At the beginning of the operation phase the study of hazards and Operability 

(HAZOP), prepared during the detailing phase should be reviewed considering the

"as built" of Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P & ID).

The operating 

personnel should participate in this task.

The HAZOP should also be revised to 

incorporate the design changes made throughout the operation phase " 

When the ANP research team questioned the Petrobras representatives regarding the approval of 

risk assessment studies, it was sent the following response as e-mail the day 07.16.2015 sent to the 

"Petrobras clarifies that because it is chartering project, not performs design 

approvals and risk analysis.

The project is the Contractor's responsibility and is 

prepared based on a functional specification (GTD) that allows the adoption of 

technical solutions by the Contractor, who is responsible for the chartering, 

operation and maintenance of the unit.

According to item 1.3 of GTD, the 

Contractor is required to hire a Classification Society for approval of the entire 

project, from the basic design to decommissioning.

The purpose of the hiring of the 

Certification Company, as described in item 1.3 itself., Is to ensure that all steps 

necessary for the design, construction and operation of Unit comply with all 

applicable laws, including those related to security.

Thus, the use of the term 

"approval", in English, aimed to enable the Project Coordination Technical 

intervene if necessary.

The approval of the project and study the various stages of the project by the 

Classification Society is legal requirement for the design certification and the 

classification unit and later get the Marine authorization to operate in Brazil.

maintain legal compliance of the unit during its operational life, the Classification 

Society conducts periodic inspections (annually) to ensure the renewal of Class 

and Statutory certificates every five years, and the Marine conducts periodic 

inspections (annual) to Statement of annual renewal Compliance Unit " 

Although Petrobras has claimed that in case of charter, it is for the installation of the Operator 

approval of projects and risk analysis, it is worth noting that in item 13.2 (Diligence in Conduct of 

Operations) of the Concession Agreement for Exploration, Development and production of Oil and 

Natural Gas entered into between the ANP and Petrobras in 1998 (IDB 0), the dealership also has 

obligations with respect to operational safety of the unit, as outlined below.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

"The Dealer plan, prepare, perform and control the Operations in a diligent, 

efficient and appropriate, in accordance with the best practices of the oil industry, 

while respecting the provisions of this Agreement and the laws, regulations and 

other rules, including those on operations issued or that may be issued by the ANP, 

and not performing any act which would or could constitute a violation of the 

economic order.

Based on this principle, and without limiting its application, the 

Concessionaire required to adopt, in all Operations, the necessary measures for 

the conservation of reservoirs and other natural resources, for the safety of people 

and equipment, and environmental protection, pursuant to Clause Twenty, and to 

obey the rules and technical procedures, scientific and relevant safety, even as the 

recovery of fluids, the prudent management of Production and control of reserves 

depletion." 

Thus, in addition to the explicit requirement in GTD unit that the Concessionaire must approve the 

studies of the risk assessment, the Concession Agreement itself also states that the dealer is 

responsible for adopting measures to ensure the safety of people, equipment and the protection of the 

environment.

In this sense, it can be seen that the operator of the installation and the Licensor shall not 

systematically evaluated the risks during the phases of the facility lifecycle.

Such failure is considered 

one of the root causes Causal Factor "inadequate Storage condensate" contrary to item 12.6.4 of 

Causal Factor n° 2: Operational degradation of cargo system of FPSO CDSM 

The charge transfer system was originally ship's construction of tank that was converted into 

FPSO therefore dated 1989.

During the ship's conversion step, significant changes were not made in 

order to upgrade the system or ensure that it obeyed the same standards and design requirements to 

which the processing plant should meet.

This fact is supported by the isometric drawings of the system 

piping, which are original to the building of the ship and suffered no review for status "as built" during 

the conversion step, demonstrating that have not made significant changes that deserved record in the 

system documentation.

In this way, by storing different fluid other than that for which it was designed without there being 

previous change management to identify and mitigate the impacts, the FPSO storage system was to be 

degraded over time in relation to its design condition.

The degraded state of the charge transfer system restricted common transfer operations between 

tanks and drainage tanks, so that means were used that introduced risk and some unfit for operations as 

inadequate spades  and the use of a pipe for condensate which had been designed to conduct inert gas.

The actions taken to try to correct the degradation of cargo transfer system without the machine 

operator was paralyzed were sometimes made without risk analysis or any evaluation of hazards and 

the global impact on activities before the change implementation.

In addition, some of the changes to 

the project were not adequately documented and relevant information for operating the system have 

not been reported in the service passage.

These factors contributed to the accident and their causal 

factors are described below.

Root Cause n° 3: Restriction alignments with spades installation / [16.3.2] 

Management of change not performed 

In 2011 it was identified water passage of slop tank port to 6C tank and slop tank starboard to 2C 

A change management form was issued with MOC-CSM-069 code for installing manual valves 

in order to establish a double lock.

In 2012 such valves had not been installed and opened new change management, MOC-CSM-091, 

to allow the repair of valves and couplings within the 2C to 5C tanks and slop tank port.

A condition 

for entry into the tanks was that MOC-CSM-069 have been completed for a particular valve, OP-084.

Figure 105 shows the OP-valve 084 before and after the accident..

Figure 105 - PB-valve 084 before and after the accident 

MOC-CSM-091 is the temporary installation of pumps, valves, pipe segments, spades , hoses and 

the use of inert gas drying line, to allow the condensate transfer between tanks.

That is, the degraded 

state of the charge transfer system restricted common transfer operations between tanks and drainage 

tanks, such that means were used that introduced risk and some unsuitable for operations such as 

inadequate spades  and employing a pipe for condensate, but had been designed to conduct inert gas.

Instead of installing manual valves as had been proposed in change management MOC-CSM-069, 

various valves of the pump house had their exchanged seals, including OP-084 as diagrams P & ID 

marked attached to MOC-CSM-091.

In these diagrams are shown for the insulation-068 and PB-1005 

The installation of the spade in the discharge line of the pump limited stripping alignment 

possibilities.

The shortest route between the stripping pump and slop tank port was precisely the line 

of OP-068, since that was the only valve in this line between the pump and the tank.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

It was shown that during audit spade installation upstream of the OP-068 valve was required for 

the replacement of the seal of this valve was not possible due to the liquid level within the port slop 

tank is higher than the valve position.

It turns out that the team that performed the activities planned in the MOC-CSM-091 made 

entry134, there was no planning for it to be removed spade in the discharge line of reciprocating pump 

and to perform repair of the OP-068 valve.

The spade was installed in January 2014 as evidenced in work permit and mechanical insulation135 

certificate.

The change management MOC-CSM-091 was issued136 in December 2012, but was revised 

in February 2014, covering the spade installation information.

However, the paddle stay in line with OP-068, located in the discharge of stripping pump was not 

included in risk analysis or any other hazard assessment and the overall impact on the activities before 

the change implementation.

This failure in the application of hazard identification mechanisms and / 

or risk analysis prior to implementing change is considered one of the root causes Causal Factor 

"storage system degradation FPSO CDSM", contrary to item 16.3.2 of SGSO.

Root Cause n° 4: Inadequate service crossing / [8.3] Inadequate communication 

between shifts  

On 20/08/2014, it was recorded in the service passage137 marine superintendent that while the shaft 

seals (seat rings) of OT41 and OT-023 port of the slop tank valves had been renovated, the tank still 

had communication problem with the tank 5C:

On 11.19.2014, it was registered in the passage of marine superintendent of service138 the 

replacement service of 5C tank valves sealing seals had been completed.

However, it was registered an 

issue of slop tank port communication, this time with the slop starboard, quoting the OT-037 valves 

and OT-040, both belonging to the line that communicates the two slop tanks, were with passing 

“We tried to purge & gas free port slop tank, but OT-037 & OT-040 are

We could not purge & gas free starboard slop tank as the wind direction was

Although the T-valve 040 operates to communicate between the two slop tanks, it was located 

inside the tank 6C, according to the P&ID139.

In 20/12/2014, the information cited in the day of service 11/19/12 passage on the slops tanks

alignment of the drain to the tank 4C: 

“The closed drains from process were diverted to 4C via flexible hose 

connected to the cow line.” 

The information on the motivation of the emptying of the tanks, namely, the problem of 

communication between the tank bottom and instructions use the header has been removed from the 

service passage report.

The only additional mention of the slop tanks was that there was a failed 

attempt to purge the tanks: 

“Gas freeing of Slop S was started but the Hydrocarbon levels are not going

 During the investigation it was evident the impossibility to pump the condensate tank 6C situation 

recorded in the service passage report in 21/01/2015142, due to the fact that there is communication 

It is worth noting that in the long term insulation registration 143, 

had insulation note in OP-038 for exchanging the seat ring in the slop tank port.

These motivations for 

emptying the port side slop tank were not registered in the service crossing report.

        Even so, after the service passage 1/21/2015, slop tank port was put back into operation, 

including the use of stripping pump to transfer fluid from the tank to 6C slop tank port.

Ie the team 

that won the previous service failed to consider the plan to repair the slop tank valve port and tried 

again transfer fluid 6C tank to the slop tank port, an activity that had previously been regarded as 

impossible by the previous staff due to communication between the tanks, all occurred in the light of

Root Cause n° 5: Outdated documents / [16.3.3] Fail in records registration and 

modifications  

The MOC-CSM-091 has diagrams (P&IDs) in its annexes144 presenting markings of the points of 

temporary connections and insulation installation points made to enable the desired changes.

These 

drawings marked remained only as an annex to MOC-CSM-091, that is, the design made available to 

the general staff through the computerized system management designs and flowcharts (Proarc) was 

the original design without the markings on the changes made.

The work permit145 and the mechanical insulation certificate146 relating to the installation of the 

paddle upstream of OP-068 valve have not been entered into the control of isolations records of long-

term147, contrary to the operator of the facility isolation procedures.

As per BW procedure148, the long-term isolation of records should be checked on a monthly basis 

in order to: (i) verify that the insulation are working as insulation Certificate; (ii) verify that Lock & 

Announcements devices are working and in good condition; and (iii) ensure awareness of long-term 

insulation between the crew.

Also according to the procedure, the record date of insulation should be 

kept in electronic copy on your computer and in print under the control of work permits coordinator 

Finally, this procedure also stipulates that the insulation that 

remain in place beyond the validity of their work permit must be recorded in long-term isolation 

control list149.

It was shown that long-term isolation of control has not been updated with the paddle upstream of 

It turns out that, even though it was open a work permit for the installation of the spade, 

isolation certificate associated with this permission considered as insulation only the closing of valves 

necessary for the installation of the spade.

The racquet itself was not considered as mechanical 

isolation in the isolation certificate, so that the spade of the final installation, the insulation had 

recorded on the certificate of release authorization.

In other means, from the release, the valves that 

had been placed in the closed position to allow the racquet facility could be operated again and

 Thus, the presence information of 

the spade in the system was not transcribed in long term isolation control.

The mechanical isolation procedure also provides that, in case of isolation of a process line, such 

isolated line should be inspected to confirm that the P & ID faithfully reflect the physical 

configuration of the insulation and that any discrepancy is marked in red color in the P & ID.

The 

same procedure also stated that the modified design was submitted to the IMO for approval and 

subsequent submission of the P & ID for corrections "as-built".

The update of the drawings is required 

for the knowledge of the current status of the installation, so that the daily operational decisions or in 

However, although the spade remained installed for over a year, the P & ID was not updated with 

the insulation information.

In the investigation it was shown that during the emergency was used by 

the IOM P & ID diagram that contains the valves of the pump house.

But the design used, taken from 

the production superintendent computer did not contain the markings, either indicating the existence of 

the flange or spade installed it.

It was also evident in other hearsay that there was doubt about the 

actual point of leakage.

The understanding of the situation at the time of emergency was hampered by the failure of the 

registration and documentation changes.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes Causal 

Factor "storage system degradation FPSO CDSM" and contrary to 16.3.3 of SGSO.

Root Cause n° 6: Alterations without management of change / [16.3.2] 

Management of change not performed  

The management MOC-CSM-091 change contains diagrams (P & ID) and photos with marking of 

insulation indications, connection points, installation of pipes and accessories.

Thus it was prepared 

planning for entry into tanks 2C to 5C and slop tank port.

However, it was evidenced that during and after repair of the valves of tanks 2C to 5C and slop 

tank port, unplanned activities were performed using modifications regarding their own MOC-CSM-

Such changes without proper change management are described below.

On 09/13/2014 the check valve (check valve) installed in the inert gas drying line (temporary line 

MOC-CSM-091) was reversed by setting a modification in relation to the MOC-CSM-091150.

Since 

then, the flow direction changed to the opposite in inert gas drying line, ie, starting to flow from the 

pump house to the cargo tanks.

With this configuration, the production could not be more taken

directly to 6C tank.

It appears that the marine superintendent of Service passage of November 2014151 

It was recorded if the instruction that 6C tank had to be used for storage of production, the return line 

valve MOC-091 should be inverted.

This change from the change management MOC-CSM-091 was 

conducted without hazard assessment and the overall impact on activities.

The reversal of the 

backflow preventer possible the emptying of the slop tank port through the inert gas drying line on the 

main deck in a direction opposite to the planned on MOC-CSM-091.

In earlier days, to transfer the 

port of slop content to 6C tank using a stripping pump and in the absence of the line of OP-068, the 

used and planned alignment was by lines inside the pump house through the OP -079 and PB-085 

valves and the downstream of the stripping pump.

After repair of valves OT-041 and OP-023 inside the port slop tank, the tank still presented 

problems, as recorded in the service passage between marine superintendents in 20/08/2014152.

log book records, in January 2015 there was emptying the slop tank starboard.

In January there was a 

simultaneous emptying of both tanks slop, so that the tubes were directed to the tank 4C in 

This is another change that took place without hazard assessment and the overall 

impact on activities prior to implementation.

The contents of the slop tank port was directed to the 4C tank using the stripping pump and, 

therefore, it was necessary to use the cleaning line 4C tank (4C aft COW line) and inert gas drying line 

(temporary line of MOC-CSM-091).

For this alignment with COW line (crude oil washing - crude oil 

wash) was necessary to hose installation in the upper deck and insulation in cleaning line to isolate the 

4C of the remaining tanks.

Such modifications configure other change that occurred without hazard 

assessment and the overall impact on the activities, before implementation, ie without use of change 

management tool.

Therefore, there was failure in the application of hazard identification mechanisms and / 

or risk analysis prior to implementing change.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes Causal

Causal Factor n° 3: Degradation of marine staff of FPSO CDSM 

        Once a system with operating restrictions, it is expected that all resources were provided so that 

the risk caused by this change in the operations to be minimized.

These resources include technical, 

human and proper qualification for people on board were able to perform their activities safely.

       In this way, the operation of a platform is only effective in safety by ensuring not only the 

maintenance systems (focus on engineering) but also maintaining a solid and experienced technical 

team knowledgeable of the foundations and rules for the performance of their functions.

It is for the 

operational safety management system implemented by companies establish requirements and provide 

funds for minimally be affected the reliability of people and systems, subject to continuous 

improvement.

      The moment degraded systems are operated by a degraded staff, without proper management of 

people, there is increased probability of failure.

Thus, the accumulation of functions, the loss of 

knowledge about the current system status, lack of updated procedures and training existing 

mechanisms, the overload caused by systemic problems and failure in training contributed to the 

occurrence of contention loss.

Root Cause n° 7: Lack of marine superintendents / [16.2] Lack of staff 

management 

The organizational structure of FPSO Cidade de São Mateus, had two marine superintendents who 

took turns with each other, leaving only one on board.

That is, while one was boarded, the other was in 

non-working time.

So were the cargo operators: there were four turns shipments, i.e., while two were 

picked up, the other two were off.

The position of marine operator was in FPSO CDSM, the rank 

immediately below the marine superintendent.

About four months before the accident, in 17/10/2014155, one of the marine superintendents 

resigned.

The BMW company failed to immediately reset his absence and, therefore, the most 

experienced cargo operators (one per shipment) began to accumulate their duties with the 

superintendent function - turns the gate scale to the marine remaining superintendent.

About two months before the accident, on 07/12/2014, the only remaining marine superintendent 

in charge also turned away from the FPSO - once it has been approved to take the IOM function 

(Platform manager) on another platform BW Offshore in Brazil (the FPSO City of São Vicente).

      It was found that this approved following the flow proposed in procedure 156 Career Development 

BW company, through competition and detailed assessment of their competence and performance 

evaluations157 performed by higher courts BW.

However, analyzing the flow of information in this 

assessment, at no time discussed the impact that his absence would give the FPSO CDSM or who 

would take over his position.

From this date, as the BW company did not immediately put back this marine superintendent 

position, the two most experienced cargo operators (one per scale boarding) began to take turns in 

both their original functions as the marine superintendent .

Finally, eleven days before the accident, on 

01/31/2015, embarked on a new FPSO CDSM marine superintendent who had previous proven 

experience of eighteen years in similar facilities158, all Group BW.

As per these eighteen, about ten 

years served as marine supervisor about four years as a marine superintendent.

However, this was his first embark on this FPSO and therefore was still in familiarization phase in 

relation to operating systems, modification, and ongoing operations, the type of fluid transferred in 

cargo movements, procedures practiced in the unit and the new team.

During audit, it sought to determine whether there was a context analysis of the absence of 

superintendents and the consequent accumulation function practiced by freight operators.

      It was identified in the change management procedure Operator BW Installation159, effective on 

the date of the accident, which had forecast personnel changes in management, including linked to 

temporary repositioning process functions that could affect the safety of operations.

According to this procedure, the flow of personal change management would be approved by the 

Division of Human Resources of the company - but should be opened / started by a requester, 

approved by the IOM of the FPSO and reviewed / approved by the Operations Manager, as illustrated 

in Figure 107, removal of the change management procedure.

However, it was evidenced both by 

testimony and by historical service ticket and performance evaluations that all Marine and OIMS team 

knew the lack of marine superintendent position, however, there was no opening of a Change 

Management form by no "requesting" (the identifier change agent)..

Figure 107 - Flow management change people contained in the BW procedure 

     Additionally, it was observed in audit that this procedure was not being applied in any case of 

change of people in the FPSO CDSM and was conducted either at the output of marine 

superintendents.

Besides the increased workload due to the accumulation of functions of the operators who took the 

superintendent function, another issue to be evaluated in this process would be the responsibility of 

these operators to assume that function.

   In its last performance evaluations160, held in October 2014, these expatriates operators were very 

highly rated, but was suggested by its evaluators to reach vacancies “Supervisor”161 and “Senior 

operator” – since both require a license ("higher marine license") and certificate ("master's certificate 

of competency") so they could be promoted to the post of marine superintendent.

added the comment that he had acted several times as marine superintendent.

    In addition, it is observed that the performance of marine operators expatriates as marine 

superintendents would be a promotion and, as such, should have been assessed following the entire 

flow required by the BW Career Development procedure.

     For these reasons, it can be said that there has been deterioration in the quality of the work done by 

the Marine team due to the departure of marine superintendents without immediate replacement, still 

causing the accumulation of tasks that an expatriate marine operator held on board - beyond absence 

of proper evaluation and certification for the post.

In this sense, it could be seen that the installation operator has not evaluated nor managed this or 

any other change of form of personal that the risks arising from these changes remain at acceptable 

Such failure is considered one of the root causes Causal Factor "Marine team Degradation of 

FPSO CDSM" and contravenes the provisions of item 16.2 of SGSO.

Root Cause n° 8: Lack of tutorial / monitoring / [3.3.2] Inadequate dimensioning of 

the training program 

     On the date of the accident, the new marine superintendent, embarked on 01/31/2015 was still 

familiarization process with the Cidade de São Mateus FPSO systems.

There are reports that some 

operations accompanied by the marine operator on board, which accumulated before the 

superintendent role, but the reports were inconclusive on this received tutoring.

However, it is certain that there was any kind of mentoring between the new superintendent and an 

effective marine superintendent who had already worked on the FPSO CDSM.

There was a scheduled 

160 MS-FRO2535-00 Performance Appraisal Form – Offshore

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

tutoring to occur during the offloading operation between 21 and 24 of February 2015162 – authoring 

chosen the former superintendent who IOM from another platform was promoted.

It was also not prepared any class of ticket report (handover) to the new marine superintendent, 

who embarked on 31/01/2015, which is oriented to use the previous handover that was on the 

computer, dated 21/01/2015 - last exchange group among marine operators.

      It should be noted that between November 2013 and the date of the incident, there was also a 

change in platform OIMs.

The OIM with whom the new marine superintendent spent most of their 

boarding also had little experience on this platform, having been leased in unit 18/11/2014 having 

done so, only two shipments FPSO CDSM.

This IOM landed early in the morning on the day of the 

accident.

The OIM who took the platform on 02/11/2015, therefore, that is, was there a few hours 

onboard when the accident occurred, given that met the new marine superintendent that morning.

      During the investigation it was possible to demonstrate the effective performance of marine 

superintendent in making decisions without having full knowledge of the conditions of systems and 

specific features of the FPSO CDSM.

For these reasons, it was found that the training was not planned 

or effective for new marine superintendent and the passage of inefficient service.

      In this sense, it can be seen that the installation operator not scaled the training program in 

accordance with the classification of functions and tasks relating to the post of marine superintendent.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes Causal Factor "Marine team Degradation of FPSO 

CDSM" and contravenes the provisions of item 3.3.2 of SGSO.

Root Cause n° 9: Lack of supervision / [1.5] Resources not available 

The organizational structure of the FPSO CDSM, there are three superintendents to subordinate 

IOM: (i) oversight of production, (ii) maintaining oversight and (iii) marine oversight.

Subordinate to 

superintendents of production and maintenance, there are supervisors and subordinates to these there is 

an operational team.

However, there is no supervisor in the FPSO CDSM marine team and marine 

operators respond directly to the marine superintendent.

During the accident investigation, it was found to exist in the BW management system, a "job 

description" (description of the tasks linked to the function with responsibilities and authorities) to 

marine supervisor163, with some tasks and responsibilities in the existing "job description" of the

marine operator164 and the marine supervisor165.

 In addition, some BW platforms operating in Brazil 

and in the world have this post of marine supervisor.

It was examined further that there is a contractual requirement with Petrobras establishing a 

minimum quantity of embarked personnel.

This requirement appears in one of the Annexes to the 

established Service Agreement with Prosafe166, as per the Figure below.

    This annex, it was possible to ascertain that there was no post of forecast "supervisor" for any of the 

three teams, but there was the appointment of a senior technician to each - indicating that this senior 

technical exert function similar to that of a supervisor.

However, only the marine team did not exist or supervisor or either "senior post operator" - and, 

according to the chart provided in the agreement, there should be for this team a 'senior position 

operator "and two" cargo operators "on board.

Nothing was reported by inspectors on board the

For these reasons, it was found that each shipment should be three marine operators, one being the 

supervisor or a senior marine operator, as provided in the contract signed with Petrobras.

this had only two FPSO marine operators per shipment - neither had oversight function or was a 

senior.

      During the investigation, it was found that lack of appropriate supervision also contributed to 

discontinuity of service information and passing control of charge transfer operations.

The functional 

disparity between the superintendent positions and marine operator, added to the excess of activities 

required for the maintenance and operation of the charge transfer system were conducive to the 

emergence of failures in performing tasks and procedures for lack of adequate supervision.

      In this sense, it can be seen that BW did not provide the resources needed for the implementation 

and operation of operational safety management system, as well as the Concession Operator failed to 

not evaluate the Setup Operator's performance.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes 

Causal Factor "Marine team Degradation of FPSO CDSM" and contravenes the provisions of item 1.5 

Root Cause n° 10: Employees with the same attribution performing different 

functions / [3.3.2] Failure to identify training/qualification requirements 

   Besides the fact discussed in the item above, that there should be three on board marine operators - 

one being supervisor or senior - when in practice there were only two, there was still a complicating 

factor: one of the two marine operators on board seemed to be overwhelmed in relation to operational 

    Theoretically activities on marine operator function should be performed by all of this function, but 

it was evidenced via testimonials, which was consensus among marine operators and marine 

superintendent of respondent’s Brazilian marine operators and expatriates occupied the same position, 

On the other hand, they played different functions.

    On board the FPSO CDSM, there were always two marine operators: a more experienced 

(expatriate) and other less experienced (Brazil).

The testimonies and documents examined (such as 

resumes, performance reviews, permissions of work and service passages of OIMS) indicate that 

expatriates operators were responsible for the "operations" and the Brazilians with "administrative 

It is understood as "operations" tasks such as alignments used for cargo handling and operation 

of the valves for the HMI screen and "administrative tasks" the offloading of occurrence records and 

fill permissions work, especially the services performed on deck.

Such disparity created a different 

workload between people occupying the same position, and the marine operators’ expatriates had 

more demand both in the operation of the systems, in control of ongoing maintenance activities in the 

planning and accumulation in attribution of marine superintendent.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

    The motivation for this difference is unclear, but there is evidence that they are linked to the long 

experience in the offshore area (expatriates had about 10 years longer than the Brazilians) at the time 

of experience in FPSO CDSM (expatriates had two years more than Brazilian), the different times of 

departure (expatriate Brazilians were 28 days and 15 days), and fluency in the English language (a 

language spoken by superintendents and OIMS).

In a statement, it was said that: (e) expatriates operators were but the service often for lack of time

another job and (ii) only when the Marine team ran out superintendent and expatriates marine 

operators took the function is that they began to teach more operational service to Brazilians (as an 

example ballast tank of the movement, disposal or produced water circulation).

It has been found through performance evaluations and turn passes this fact, labor absorption 

referring to all the operational part for only one of onboard marine operators, was fully aware of both 

crew members, as OIMS and superintendents as well as management of BW operations.

It was found 

that there was a demand for new expatriate cargo operator and pumping again.

The service crossing between OHMs report of 11/02/2015 is recorded on the specific problem of 

Brazilian marine operators and the proposed solution of the problem: 

“I would strongly recommend to get rid of both (..) we have on board as Marine 

Operators.

They do not show an interest in their work and not willing to learn.

Unit’s operations and procedures knowledge is not sufficient for their position.

plans to shorten one Marine position on board” 

This problem also affects the pumping function, such that transcription from the same passage 

service below: 

“(...) also agreed to get 2 expats pumpman replacing Brazillian, so it worth to 

remind him of the current status” 

    For these reasons, it was found that each shipment there were two marine operators occupying the 

same position but with different functions, possessing levels of knowledge in completely different 

Added to this fact the accumulation of marine superintendent function - and 

sometimes even as bombeador3 when the holiday one of the pumpers - showing a workload and 

responsibility in a function considered of great impact on the operational safety of a unit floating 

production.

In this sense, it can be seen that the installation operator did not identify the levels of training, 

expertise, skill and knowledge specific to the function, which enables the employee to perform the 

tasks pertaining to the post occupied by him.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes Causal 

Factor "Marine team Degradation of FPSO CDSM" and contravenes the provisions of item 3.2.2 of 

Root Cause nº 11: Lack of training in operational procedures / [3.3.4] Failure to 

identify training/qualification requirements in operational procedures 

     At the time of the accident there was a training matrix for all on board the workforce of the FPSO 

CDSM for training considered mandatory by the Operator Installation (NR-10, NR-34, CBSP, HUET, 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

among others).

However, it had not been implemented a training matrix in operating procedures for 

teams aboard the FPSO CDSM, although there is evidence that this matrix was in preparation and 

close to being finalized.

    In addition to this matrix, which is a control of the training tool, has still not been implemented by 

the time of the accident, there was no training records in specific operational procedures for the 

Marine team.

In some testimony was reported ignorance of the written procedure for charge transfer 

between tanks and the lack of formal training in this procedure for this unidade3.

    During audit diligence there were evidenced that marine team members had training certificates in 

some procedures related to operational safety, such as: mechanical insulation, Work Permit and Task 

Risk Analysis (Job safety analysis and Risk Assessment - JSA) plus some Forms compliance checks 

with procedure for Simultaneous Operations Helicopter and offloading operations.

However, it was 

not observed any kind of training to transfer load between tanks involved with this operation 

(pumping, marine operators or new marine superintendent).

    For these reasons, it was found that there were no training features at all operational procedures that 

impact the operational safety as well as there was, at the time of the accident, any control to ensure 

that the workforce remained trained in the procedures.

     In this sense, it can be seen that the installation operator did not establish the skills and training as 

much as needed to carry out the activities under operational procedures.

Such failure is considered as 

one of the root causes of the Causal Factor "Degradation upon the marine team of FPSO CDSM" as it 

opposes the provisions of item 3.3.4 of SGSO.

7.5 Causal Factor n° 4: Operating the stripping pump with the offload sealed 

       The control of the operation of the stripping pump was made by the marine operator 

through the Human-Machine Interface (IHM) on the load cross docking system, located in a 

room adjacent to the process plant control room, and through the percentage adjustment 

opening the steam valve and monitoring the offload pressure.

The IHM of the load handling 

system is the supervisory system display where the marine operator visualize/modify the 

position of the remotely operated valves, is displays the valves with a simple statement of 

position and controls the operation of the system pumps.

In general, the confirmation of 

operation, triggering operations and stop pump were assisted by the pump operator.

       The monitoring parameters through the opening percentage of the vapor control valve and 

offload pressure led to the failure of interpretation of the operating condition of stripping 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

pump because they are indirect measures of alternative pump displacement.

The number of 

strokes is a direct measurement of the pump displacement.

       In the meantime, in order to evaluate the operation of the pump based on the percentage 

of opening of the vapor control valve, it should be considered the pump can be changed by the 

following conditions: i) different steam facts provided, i.e.

temperature and pressure imply 

differences in the operation of the pump; ii) the opening of the steam lines of drains to 

influence the steam supplied by the pump; and iii) there is a different relative displacement of 

the pistons for different pumped fluids.

       To rely on the marine operator's interpretation of the ratio between the percentage of 

opening of the vapor control valve and the number of strokes, considering the different 

process variables causes high probability of errors since the operation is no longer based on 

direct parameters of the operated process and is now carried out according to the marine 

operator's as by own experience.

It should be noted the indication of the number of strokes per 

minute was provided in the stripping pump project but has not been implemented yet.

       For the composition of the system operational overview, the marine operator then needed 

to establish the percentage of openings of the vapor control valve and to observe the pressure 

at the offload from the pump in order to infer directly in the stripping operation of the pump.

       The purpose of the offload pressure indication of the stripping pump in IHM turn out to 

aggregate into the increased possibility of error from marine operators since the information 

pump offload pressure as then now represented by a pop up window, or to be omitted in the 

operation of other systems.

Even watching the pressure in the offload, the scale presented was 

considered inadequate by the present values above the Maximum Feasible Operating Pressure 

(PMTA) of the system, which made the pressure reading to depend on the visual acuity of the 

marine operator.

As per such view there was also no indication of Maximum Operating 

      In this scenario, an operating procedure would be essential for the control of operational 

hazards and the performance of the functions of cargo operators, given that, for example, 

describe the charge transfer operation between tanks with use of stripping pump, define issues 

related to check valves and lines, as well as explicit prohibitions.

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

However, there was no operational procedure to indicate the parameters and procedures to 

be followed by the marine169 operator and by pumping in maneuvering change collectors and 

how to operate the stripping pump.

      Continuous monitoring of stripping pump to be done by pumping throughout its 

operation, which was appointed in HAZOP safeguarding of marine systems, was not reflected 

in any formal written from the operator site.

      Nevertheless, it was found during the hearings provided to ANP that during the starting 

operations and stop the stripping pump, there was the practice of the pumping be next to the 

pump in order to perform specific actions drainage during the match as well as to monitor and 

report the condition of the equipment for the marine radio operator.

Additionally, the practice and procedure of load170 cross docking devices operations 

indicated the operations of the storage system valves to be monitored by pumping, when 

possible, which prevented the physical presence of the pump installation site at all times.

It was then found that the operation that caused the loss of containment, the pump 

operator found stripping away of the pump as it performed the activities necessary for the new 

alignment1.

       In addition, management failures the procedure of cargo transfer equipment operations 

established by Prosafe was not continued and updated by BW, becoming uncontrolled 

Lack of knowledge in operating procedures is supported by 

the absence of a training plan in operational procedures.

     There are differences in the testimonies of those who in fact, are the marine operator or 

marine superintendent, attended the maneuver valves which shut the pump offload.

when evaluating system operation data, it was found the pump operation with closed offload 

occurred in other situations days preceding the accident.

Such associated facts led to the situation where it is allowed to operate a reciprocating 

pump with its offload lines closed, a fact crucial to the accident.

This causal factor and their 

causes, which are described below, are indicated in Figure 111.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

Root Cause n° 12: Outdated/unavailable procedure / [1.5] Failure 

to furnish the resources 

It was found by consulting the tracking spreadsheet migration procedures171, that several 

procedures had not yet been evaluated and migrated to the document control system - 

Management System (MS).

Among them is the procedure "Operational Management System - 

Operations of Cargo Equipment", which describes and defines the step by step of the 

procedures for the operation of the Load System equipment and applies to the FPSO Cidade 

      According to interlocutors of BW Offshore, as an alternative to the lack of evaluation of 

some Prosafe operating procedures for migration and inclusion in documentation control 

system BW Offshore (MS), it was decided to make available the old procedures of the unit, 

which had not been updated in the internal network to the FPSO Cidade de São Mateus, 

outside the established document control procedure in the company.

     Among these, the procedure was made available by "Operational Management System - 

Operations of Cargo Equipment".

However, since the BW had no training process that 

includes training in operational procedures, there is no evidence that the FPSO CDSM navy 

team had domain of the requirements of this procedure.

      It was found that the applicability of the procedure "Operational Management System - 

Operations of Cargo Equipment" had not yet been evaluated by the team of BW Offshore and 

it still had to identify the "Prosafe Production".

      Corroborating the fact that it had not yet gone through the Prosafe migration to BW 

Offshore, in that procedure included the cover of Prosafe logo and the following warning: 

171 OMS Procedure review log CDSM (Master Copy) – Issue Date: 01/02/2014

Figure 112 - Warning contained on the cover of the operating procedure of charging system 

Additionally, in this procedure, the section in which is described the charge transfer 

operation in an emergency situation, there is described below acknowledgment confirming 

that the procedure was obsolete: 

Figura 12 – Item referente à operação de transferência de carga em situação de emergência 

     These inserts capitalized in operation, associated with lack of control of the information by 

using different means to control information set by BW Offshore discourages its use, making 

it inefficient.

Such a condition was considered analogous to the lack of operating procedure, 

since such a risk control mechanism was not kept by the BW and its use was discouraged by 

the procedure itself.

      In this sense, it can be seen that the installation operator did not provide resources for the 

development, implementation and updating procedures of operational safety management 

system of the FPSO Cidade de São Mateus, in order to properly manage operational risks.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes Causal Factor "Operate the stripping pump 

with offload sealed" and as it may contravene upon the provisions as set forth in item 1.5 of 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

7.5.2 Root Cause n° 13: Failure to implement the recommendations and hazard analysis 

of safeguards and security studies / [12.6.3] failure to implement corrective actions 

     The Marine HAZOP173, still performed in the unit's design phase in 2007, set for the 

diversion of "no flow" in the drainage operation of the cargo tanks, the following causes: (i) 

failure stripping pump, (ii) hydraulic valves closed stripping the offload pump, or (iii) closed 

hydraulic valves or locks the stripping suction pump.

For this scenario classified as high risk, 

the following results were listed: (i) damage to the pump, (ii) delays the stripping operation, 

and (iii) pressure in the lines due to the locked offload, resulting in loss of containment and 

the possibility fire in the pump house.

     Thus, it was found that the draining operation with the offload of the closed bomb had yet 

been studied in the design phase and the consequences associated with this practice had been 

identified.

However, it was found that one of the safeguards associated with this scenario 

(closed valve in the offload of stripping pump to the final destination) was not implemented, 

namely: "the presence in the pump house throughout the time during stripping operations." 

      It is noteworthy that such protection requires the permanence of a person for long periods 

in the pump house, exposing it to the risk scenarios identified in this part of the installation.

This is due to the maintenance of older operating systems, arising from the time the unit was 

an oil tanker, which have not been modernized in his conversion to the platform.

      The operational practice established in the FPSO CDSM did not include all operating 

phases of the stripping pump, only the starting and stopping of the pump, and it was not 

reflected in a procedure / formal education.

The operation procedure of loading equipment, in 

turn, limited the implementation of safeguarding the monitoring valve positioning and further 

brought the proviso that such monitoring would be done "if possible", except that it is not 

consistent with the protection, described above.

       In this sense, it can be seen that the installation operator did not ensure the 

implementation of safeguards from risk analysis.

Such failure is considered one of the root

     As can be seen in the above figures, during the months of January and February, the 

percentage of opening of the steam control valve fitted to match the pump ranged from 10% 

In addition, it is noted that on some days this provision was carried out gradually and 

on other days it happens instantaneously, although it was highlighted in testimony provided to 

the ANP, the way to provide pump steam would be according to the experience the marine 

operator.

    Additionally, the differences in the ways of operating the stripping pump were also 

observed in relation to the actuation of the valves upstream and downstream of the pump.

the basis of supervisory data, it was found that, on some days, stopping the pump was 

preceded by closing the offload valve when it was still operating, while on other days the 

closing of the offload occurred only after stopping the pump.

    The lack of standardization in closing the offload of the pump while this work was 

observed in the supervisory system data, although it has been highlighted in testimonials for a 

reciprocating pump such that the stripping pump, the correct would not operate it with a

    The divergence shown above procedures, is due to the fact that the procedure "Operational 

Management System - the Cargo Equipment Operations175 ” It was still incomplete by not explaining 

which bans would apply to the operation of stripping pump more explicitly by not mentioning the fact 

that the offload line valves stripping pump should not be closed before the pump stopped or in any 

situation there was flow.

There is also no mention in regard to the adjustment of the percentage of 

opening of the steam control valve in the phase between starting and normal operation and does not 

address the procedures and parameters to be followed in the event of a change in the alignment of the 

suction or offload.

     In turn, when assessing the stripping pump manual, the only mention of the closing of the pump 

offload is made in its item 3, which deals with the stopping of the pump, where there was the 

statement that: "after the parade pump, close the suction and offload valves.

" The context of this 

statement is related to the total stop of the pump, unlike the alignment change of situation that was 

held by the Navy team FPSO CDSM.

No mention of the ban of pump operation with a closed offload 

was made at any operating procedure.

     In this sense, it can be seen that the installation of the operator did not have complete and clear 

operating procedure with regard to the prohibitions and restrictions for the use of systems and 

equipment in order to maintain control of risks.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes

Root Cause n° 15: Information of pump strokes not available in supervisory system / 

[10.2.1] Noncompliance to project criteria 

During the investigation it has evidenced the existence of an informal procedure of 

starting and stopping the stripping pump.

For the document analysis, it was concluded that the 

pump instruction manual176 It was used as the reference procedure for starting operations and 

equipment failure.

The instructions in this document for the operation of the pump refer to 

strokes rate (strokes) which is a direct measure of the pump, as shown in Figure 117 below, 

which shows part of this document in which reference is made to strokes rate bomb as 

"required revolutions" and "rated revolutions".

Figura 13 – Stripping pump manual extract  

It was observed in audit that the pump manual indicates the basics of starting, stopping 

and operating the equipment, but the operators were acting according to their previous 

experience and without the use of strokes counter information.

According to data sheet stripping pump177, it could provide information of strokes count

       Reading the strokes count, being a direct information of the operation of stripping pump, allow an 

unambiguous assessment about stopping the pump for marine operator.

       Thus, the availability information of strokes count for the marine operator of the unit since the 

beginning of the operation due to lack of commissioning load control system and ballasting179, is 

evidence that the operator did not meet the design criteria and not considered good engineering

Causal Factor nº 5: Loss of primary condensed material 

    In systems where there are devices that perform work on fluid, such as pumps and 

compressors, there is the possibility of pressure downstream and therefore critical procedures 

and systems are established so that, with this, safety barriers prevent loss of containment .

With respect to positive displacement pumps, to operate with a closed offload, there may be a 

break weakest point in the system downstream of the pumps.

    The system downstream of the outlet cylinder of the stripping pump had as single barrier 

overpressure against safety valve (PSV), physical barrier recirculating the pumped fluid to the 

pump suction, however this valve lacked a calibration routine, which made their uncertain 

reliability.

     How much of the load transfer systems was originally from the time of construction of the 

oil tanker and its conversion into platform did not observe the safety philosophy applies to the 

processing plant, the system was kept obsolete without alarms, and interlocks, contrary 

standards and good engineering practice.

     The containment point loss (leakage) occurred in a flange where a spade, possibly 

By not meet manufacturing standards that ensure its suitability to the 

system pressure rating, it may not need to insert the spade introduced a weakest point in the 

system, decreasing the Maximum Operating Pressure Allowable (MAWP) of the same.

      As the leak point was concreted to prevent further leaks, it could not perform analyzes of 

the spade properties and their respective failure mode.

On request to BW Offshore companies 

and Petrobras, the determination of the pressure reached in the offload of the pump proved to 

be uncertain, it is not possible to say that the pressure reached by the system exceeded or not 

the MAWP.

     It is noteworthy that assess the PSV bench may prove incompatible with the valve of the 

situation at the time of the accident, making the results of this purely speculative assessment.

Thus, it is considered that the full details of the causes of this causal factor can only be 

concluded after the analysis of the properties and the spade failure modes, which will only be 

possible after the unit is placed in the yard without term situation set to occur.

   It was considered then, conservatively, that the possible causes are related both to the failure 

of the spade in a position above or below the system MAWP, for failure to design and update

the load transfer system for unit conversion and various managerial failures that led to the 

leak in the pump house.

    Above the MAWP, considers the absence of PSV calibration routine (critical system) and 

no alarms and interlocks as possible causes.

Below the MAWP, it was found that the 

unavailability of type JIS spades  (Japanese standard), the lack of space (allowance) for the 

installation of pressure class spades  appropriate to the system, the lack of spades  installation 

control procedures and improvisation spades  are possible causes.

These causes are detailed as

Root Cause n° 16: Lack of inspections, calibration and tests plans to 

ensure minimum reliability for the safety valve from the stripping pump / 

[13.2.1] Lack of inspections, calibration and tests plans 

The opening pressure (set pressure) of the safety valve design stripping pump was 16.5 

kgf/cm 2g, indicated in the data sheet stripping the pump, as shown in Figure 121 below.

The 

design pressure of the cargo transfer system according to the project documentation180 is 16 

kgf / cm2 g, lower than the valve opening pressure.

The value of opening pressure of the 

project so contrary design criterion which states that the pipeline design pressure must not be 

lower than the opening pressure relief valve181.

Figure 121 - Project Opening pressure of pressure relief valve stripping pump 

As for its maintenance and calibration, it is known that as good engineering practice, a 

pressure relief valve must be periodically inspected and calibrated to ensure a minimum 

reliability.

During the investigation it was shown that there was no existing relief valve 

calibration routine stripping the pump set on the unit's maintenance system (MAXIMO).

When notified to present calibration history of the evidence of the offload of the pressure 

relief valve stripping pump since the start of production of the FPSO Cidade de São Mateus to 

the date of the accident, the BW presented two documents: (i) inspection certificate held on

another document 02/08/2010183 has an opening pressure set to 16 kgf / cm2.

In the latter 

document, the field "Next inspection" in this document is not filled.

There was, therefore, change the valve set pressure of 16.5 kgf / cm 2 to 16 kgf / cm2.

When asked about the reason for this change of valve set pressure, the operator of the facility 

said it does not have evidence or reasons for a possible change in the set pressure safety valve 

stripping pump.

Widely used in industry, API RP 576 standard does not prescribe a schedule for carrying 

out inspection and calibration of pressure relief valves, however, it recommends that a set 

interval of time for each pressure relief device to be established184.

It was informed during inspection operation 185 initially the valve maintenance and 

calibration was held mandatory when performing inspection by the NR-13 on the suction 

filter of the stripping pump (33PB002-CA001).

such this standard, periodic inspection routine was abandoned and hence the valve no longer 

kept being inspected and calibrated.

        Since there is no inspection routine and test and considering the long period between the 

last adjustment of the set pressure of the stripping pump relief valve, there is no way rule out 

the possibility of failure of this device if the pressure reached downstream of stripping pump 

has exceeded the MAWP.

        It can be said therefore that there was no plan and procedures defined for inspection, 

testing and maintenance for the valve in question.

Such failure is considered one of the root 

causes Causal Factor "primary containment loss condensed material" and contravenes the 

provisions of item 13.2.1 of SGSO.

Root Cause n° 17: Lack of interlocks in stripping pump / [10.3] Failure to 

consider certain aspects which may introduce hazards to the project 

    The API RP 14C compliance rule186 suggests a way to provide the shutdown of flow supply 

in case of overpressure (pressure above the MAWP) of a system or equipment.

This 

recommendation is further enhanced in the same standard to address the specific security 

The standard recommends that hydrocarbon pumps are 

equipped with interlocking device (SDV - Shut Down Device) that interrupts the flow and 

stop the pump, both in case of high pressure as in the case of low pressure.

In case of high 

blood pressure, loss of containment is avoided by shutting down the equipment before the 

pressure reaches excessive levels.

The low pressure actuation rejoining equipment 

subsequently to the occurrence of rupture and consequent loss of containment minimizing the 

amount of spilled hydrocarbon.

The interlock device is considered by the API RP 14C the form of primary overpressure 

protection.

Additionally, the standard indicates that the security system is to act primarily 

through the automatic tracking operation by automatic protective action in the event of an 

abnormal condition detection sensor operation.

 It is valuable to note the safety philosophy of the unit lists upon the API 14C among the 

list of codes and standards should be observed during the implementation of all phases of the 

Other interlocking recommended in good engineering practice is the interlocking of the 

possible leak of gas supply due to a gas alarm.

The API RP 14J determines that gas detection 

systems should alert the staff through audible alarms and / or visual and activate valves to turn 

off gas supplies in the event of detection188, and mentions the API 14C as a source of 

recommendations for the detection system.

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

The APIRP14C, in turn, reinforces this recommendation, adding the alarm should be 

activated in maximum 25% from the LIE (Lower Explosive Limit) and automatic corrective 

actions, such as closing shutdown valves in the sources of gas and disconnect the power 

supplies of equipment not suitable for hazardous areas, should be started no more than 60% 

from LIE189.

Documents established during the unit's design phase predict, to the area of the pump 

room, alarm in case of 10% LEL gas detection and shutdown (shutdown) in case of gas 

detection 30% LEL.

This action is expected, for example, in case of unit Safety190 and 

specification of the fire detection system, heat and gas191, which appoints to the matrix cause 

and effect as a reference for automatic actions triggered by the fire and gas detection system.

After a matrix of cause and effect192 in order to check how the automatic actions were 

implemented, it is possible to verify that the actions planned for gas detection if 20% LEL in 

the pump room include stopping the pumping of the charge pumps (33PA001A/B/C).

In the 

pump room, in addition to cargo pumps, the pumps were located ballast and stripping pump.

It is not provided for any action concerning the stripping pump (interruption of the drive or 

closing admission).

As the stripping pump also moves hydrocarbon, in case of gas detection in the pump 

room, this pump could also be the source of the gas flow, so only paralyze cargo pumps did 

not meet fully the shutdown criterion of the pump room .

The implementation of the shutdown of actions recommended in best practice and set out 

in project documents proved incomplete because it was not envisaged the total shutdown of 

the pump room equipment, since the stripping pump was not contemplated.

It notes that the 

gas detection systems and shutdown to address critical safety systems.

Thus, were not considered in facility design all aspects that could introduce risks to 

operational safety.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes Causal Factor "primary 

containment loss condensed material" and contravenes the provisions of section 10.3 of 

Root Cause n° 18: Lack of the high pressure alarm in the stripping pump offload / 

[10.3] Failure to consider certain aspects which may introduce hazards to the project 

The APIRP14C compliance rule193 establishes protective actions to be triggered manually 

by the operator in case of unsafe condition of observation or alert alarm as one of the modes 

of operation of offshore production platforms security system.

It notes that the safety 

philosophy of the unit lists the API RP 14C among the list of codes and standards that should 

be observed during the implementation of all phases of the project194.

        As to the stripping pump, there is as unsafe operating condition a offload pressure value 

greater than the maximum permissible system.

As already discussed, the HMI displayed the 

offload pressure of the stripping pump in a pop up window and the pressure display range was 

inadequate and did not explain the value of the maximum pressure system operation.

Additionally, there was no document setting out the maximum pressure value operation of the 

system of charges that should be observed by the operator.

Such information was not in the 

operational procedure in the cargo system.

        Thus, the observation of this operation parameter and the identification of the occurrence 

of an unsafe condition were uncertain, requiring the implementation of a high pressure alarm 

on pump offload to ensure compliance with the requirement of the standard.

The terminal was not equipped with high-pressure alarm in the pump offload to alert the 

operator of an unsafe operating condition and trigger response actions in an attempt to avoid 

The lack of alarm, once increasing the risk of operation, in the meantime 

allocating a dependent evaluation barrier operator, the identification of the deviations in the 

process parameter depended on a constant monitoring of the offload pressure and an

Depending on the marine operator, the action was adopted or not.

     For these reasons, it appears that were not considered in the design of the facility,

could introduce risks to operational safety.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes 

Causal Factor "primary containment loss condensed material" and contravenes the provisions

Root Cause n° 19: Failure in the control of spare parts / [8.2] Failure to

     It was observed in audit that the MAXIMO system was used to track inventory on board.

The parts request registration on the MAXIMO system was carried out in accordance with the 

minimum inventory definition registered in the system itself, or according to request on-board 

Initially, the storekeeper was solely responsible for this activity.

Later, the responsibility 

was shared with supervisors and superintendents of onboard departments who had less 

knowledge of the system usage, leading also to a lack of standardization in requests.

     It had been found before the accident that the inventory record was not consistent with the 

items physically present on board.

This inconsistency led to the presence of a person on board 

the Singapore office to make the conference and adjust inventory, and in the day of the 

accident this activity was running.

      As for the inventory control spades , once evidenced in the hearing between the 

availability of the spade on the platform and the manufactured spade on board.

Although there 

were on board an inventory of the type of the spades  rendered for the process plant, when a 

spade was not found the employees used to manufacture racquets in the workshop at the 

engine room.

There is spade manufacturing evidence in marine service crossing report195.

Evidence shows that, as evidenced from the audit diligence, the door of the warehouse, 

located in the space before the entrance of the engine room, had its torn protective screen.

     It became evident during the audit the screen had been installed in order to keep out 

strangers without the presence of the person responsible, but that even with the installation 

screen people continued to raid the warehouse.

     It has been found, the operator did not have strong control system information on spare

According to the document containing the design criteria for process modules196, the 

process plant (topside) should have permission to install insulation elements, is through the 

use of flanges with spacers that provide the necessary clearance for insertion of a spade in the 

line, either through use of a flange-like "figure 8" that can take open or closed position.

It was found that the layout of the pump house lines had no prediction for the installation 

of insulating elements, which implies the absence of play (allowance) for installation in a

Audit, it was evident that the difficulty of 

installing a suitable thickness spade in marine pipe line caused the installation of possibly 

inadequate flange spade on the amount of OP-068 valve.

    Therefore, it is concluded that the lines of the charge transfer system did not meet 

mandatory requirements for the process plant lines, although all these pipes work with 

    The lack of gaps in the lines of charge transfer system meant that the crew members could 

not properly carry out the insulation in the flange to the amount of OP-068 valve, then

Failure to apply for the pump house the same engineering standards used for the process 

plant for the conversion project prevented the installation of proper spade, contributing to the 

insertion in line with a permissible pressure element probably below the MAWP system.

It was found that there were practical manufacturing spades  on board.

During the 

hearings it was stated that at first, these spades  were made for short interventions, whenever 

the closing of a line, but without the forecast of pressurizing the same was needed.

no record in marine superintendent of Service passage198 which occurred the spade 

manufacturing on board to be installed between flanges for long term operations.

Racquets for use in the cargo transfer system lines should address the ongoing 

standardization in the project document which defines the material specifications for valves 

and pipe the marine systems and utilities199.

However, there is evidence that the production of 

shipboard spades  follow any standardization of engineering.

It should also be noted that, according to the document on Safe Practices insulation work, 

albeit confusing content in Portuguese, we recommend the use of physical disconnection 

whenever "reasonably practicable", justifying it would be simpler monitor the removal of a 

section of the pipe to check if a spade or a figure eight was installed correctly200.

It is worth 

mentioning the spades  for BWV-1005 and the OP-068 were installed in place where there 

was fairly short pipe section between the valve and the spade so that the removal solution pipe 

section could have been adopted , freeing up space for installing blind flanges or double locks 

on the ends of the line.

The piping runs between spade and valve are shown in the following

As to the selection of the method of isolation for incoming service cargo tank was defined 

as the positive isolation method should be adopted for deck lines and the double lock method 

      During audit it was informed that the spade was installed upstream of the OP-068 valve 

due to the fact the liquid level inside the port side slop tank exceeds the share of OP-068 

It was alleged that it was not safe to replace the seat ring of OP-068, was soon installed 

the spade.

That is to say therefore that this scenario should also be considered if the pipe 

section to be removed.

In any event, the port slop tank was emptied for repair, at which time 

the spade could have been removed or in which the pipe section could have been taken to 

improve the quality of the insulation.

       The lack of sufficient slack in the load transfer system for installation of a spade with 

adequate thickness, the decision not to carry out the isolation removing pipe section and the 

possible unavailability of appropriate spare parts on board favored the isolation of the drive 

line flange loads the amount of OP-068 valve with an improvised spade, made on board, 

possibly inadequate to the line pressure class without prior assessment of hazards and global 

impact on activities.

The plant operator has not ensured that the use of isolation with distinct feature of the

   In the event of a leak in potentially explosive atmospheres in training indoors, it must 

consider the possibility of event escalation to a fire scenario and / or explosion.

and procedures should be provided for once there is the formation of an explosive 

atmosphere, there are conditions for the crew can act to control the situation, mitigate the risks 

of escalation, eliminating the explosive atmosphere for recall to return the operational routine.

    For the success of mitigation actions, emergency procedures and resources for emergency 

response should be pre-planned, drawing on the use of all available resources, including the 

time of assessment of scenarios, always scarce resource for teams response to accidents on 

board the platforms.

     Institutional support should outline how to act in various possible emergencies at the 

facility and should be described in the Emergency Response Plan of the unit.

However, it 

could be seen that failed in assessing the risk scenario and emergency response that caused the 

accident, maximizing the effects of an occurrence of an explosive atmosphere rather than 

mitigate them, due to the absence of clear instructions and definition of accident scenarios in 

the Emergency Response Plan of the unit that did not include scenarios identified in the unit 

risk study.

    Without identifying the Emergency Answers to plan the necessary resources to the incident 

scene, the crew aboard the FPSO CDSM at the time of crisis, could not adopt appropriate 

solutions to mitigate the explosive atmosphere scenario, leading to exposure of people board 

dangerous situations, in which the likelihood of scale and the potential severity were 

increased significantly.

    This exposure of persons, whether belonging to the brigade teams or the other response 

functions for emergency, resulted largely from the resulting victims of this accident, ie the 

spill response incident led to an increase of the damage caused by the event as a whole.

    Low operational discipline also demonstrated clear when there was the creation of a 

technical team to support the emergency response team, without this team was provided or 

possessed assignments in the Emergency Response Plan.

During the incident, even with the 

knowledge that there were gas detection using fixed sensors installed at the bottom of the 

pump house, some people who formed the technical staff were sent along with the firefighters 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

to evaluate the scenario in an explosive atmosphere.

Another symptom that confirms the low 

operational discipline was the partial or total demobilization of the people of the respective 

meeting points, even with the permanence of confirmed gas detection.

    Another cause of the danger people from exposure due to the setting of the meeting points 

for people with response function to the emergency, made without being considered safety 

studies of FPSO CDSM therefore without proper assessment of the effects of a possible 

explosion scenario in the pump house (or staggering) about the points against.

It is 

noteworthy that one person was killed and others were injured as they stood in their respective 

meeting points.

The causal factor called exposure of individuals is shown in Figure 126 and their causes

Root Cause n° 22: Lack of proper instructions upon emergency procedure 

/ [15.2.1] Incomplete / inadequate procedure 

 As a response to the emergence of BW philosophy203, the Emergency Response Plan 

(ERP) should be prepared during the detailed design phase and should be implemented during 

the operation phase.

The plan must contain at least the guidance on training requirements and 

skills, often simulated and testing the response of structures to the emergence and procedures 

and responsibilities to be followed in various emergency situations, including response 

activities to emergency and plans action.

       The PRE204 presented the FPSO response structure in emergency situations, 

distinguishing the functions and their meeting places in many unit points, either in the CCR 

(Central Control Room), on the ward, in the control room of the engine, the boat of rapid 

rescue, the local brigade with equipment and in the cafeteria (temporary refuge).

However, it 

was not presented to the ICT structure (Incident Command Team), i.e.

the incident command team.

Within the categorization of incidents by severity, to the level of incident categories II 

(major) and Level III (catastrophic), was provided for in the procedure for the mobilization of 

an emergency the response team in the MECC (Main Emergency Control Centre) with 

following leaders: Operations Manager, Human Resources Manager, Manager in Charge and 

SMS Manager.

However, it was found that this procedure provided for in the structure was 

not compatible with the structure set up by BW Offshore, a fact that also reflects a system 

For example, do not exist in the structure of BW Offshore in Brazil the

   There is the note applies only to detect if that states: "treat two gas detectors or two fire 

detectors in a zone or a single detector where there is no voting principle as a confirmed 

detection".

In fact, at this point the PRE is confused when considering early voting in 

emergency response procedures, as to minimize the risk of response teams, any detection 

should be considered real, regardless of the voting principles of instrumented systems safety.

    It is noteworthy that the FPSO CDSM accident response actions should consider that there 

was confirmed gas detection in the pump house because: (i) throughout the occurrence always 

at least two detectors presented indicating the presence of gas; and (ii) there was a visual 

confirmation of hydrocarbon leakage to the offshore incident command, so confirming the gas 

detection.

    However, when evaluating only detection condition as shown in Table 15, it was deemed 

appropriate by the company that had sending operator equipped with portable gas detector to 

investigate the situation indication of the presence of gas through a single detector.

addition, the PRE over your text does not indicate additional procedures to drive the general 

alarm in case of detection confirmed, leaving the responsibility that in time of crisis, the 

offshore incident command on the FPSO CDSM assess, planned, identify the response 

resources and take decisions.

Such lack of procedure is reflected in the absence of explosive atmosphere scenario in 

Incident Management Guides, the FPSO CDSM PRE members, who had the accident 

scenarios and a specific checklist for each, containing the full detail of the subsequent actions.

Figure 128 presents an incident management guide example contained in PRE for the fire 

scenario in the engine room.

Thus, despite the setting of the presence of gas will not be 

triggered contemplated in memory card, detailed procedures for this scenario were not made 

explicit through an incident management guide.

        Thus, the incident offshore decided to send command to the pump house persons, even 

with confirmed gas detection at that location.

It is emphasized that this was an action provided 

for PRE to another scenario and that this document contained no explicit prohibition to do so.

       It is considered a basic condition for the development of any emergency response plan 

that earlier actions to mitigate events, should be considered to minimize the exposure of 

people to possible effects of the event in progress.

In this context, the scenarios should be 

clearly defined and response procedures shall indicate the objective actions and explicit 

prohibitions, in order to minimize exposure of people to unmanaged risks.

In this sense, it could be seen that the plant operator not prepared and documented 

operating procedure with clear and specific instructions to carry out the activities safely, in 

order to minimize human exposure to risks arising from the response to the emergency by 

setting failed development control and operational procedures.

Such failure is considered one 

of the root causes Causal Factor "People Exposure" and contravenes the provisions of item 

Root Cause n° 23: Accidental scenarios in the PRE of installation operator 

does not include the outcome over the study of Hazards of the Unit / [14.2.3] 

Failure to identify accidental scenarios 

      The Safety Case document208 It contained examples of potential identified emergencies 

that should be covered in the emergency response, among which figured as the first item 

listed, the "hydrocarbon leak resulting in fire / explosion." 

There is therefore a discrepancy between the reported accident scenarios in the Safety 

Case and the assumptions made in the Emergency Response Plan and were not disclosed 

during the investigation records of how, from the accident scenarios identified in the Safety 

Case or other procedures, standards or best practices in Engineering: (i) the Emergency 

Response Plan reached 25 (twenty five) scenarios presented in the response procedures to 

emergencies, (ii) what criteria used for the selection of the scenarios presented in the PRE and

(iii) as to why some scenarios, like the gas leak and explosion scenarios in the pump house 

and engine room were not covered comprehensively (through incident management guide 

containing detailed actions) in that procedure.

In addition, the Safety Case also enlists209 the recommendations from the fire and 

explosion assessment study (FEA - Fire and Explosion Assessment), among which worth 

mentioning Recommendation 7: 

"[7]to ensure that the results of the FEA are considered and included in the 

Emergency Response Plan (ERP) in order to be taken all reasonable action to 

limit the consequences of dangerous events.

The FEA information can help 

emergency the response team (p.

Fire brigade) to understand the risks of 

such scenarios and to prevent injury to team members in the exercise of its 

function during accidents.

The ERP installation should include the following 

 Not to send the fire brigade to an area in which the scaling potential is 

still present; 

Correct use of radio and / or speaker systems device to alert the staff, 

especially the brigade firefighting, potential sudden combustion scenarios 

("flash fire") and gas cloud explosion due to delayed ignition flammable cloud.

This is particularly critical during low wind speed conditions, when high 

pressure systems releases have demonstrated the potential to generate 

flammable clouds able to cover the entire FPSO; (...) 

 Training and regular exercises for emergencies based on a range of 

scenarios, as shown in FEA.

Since: (i) the PRE contained no explicit prohibition of dispatch of the brigade area 

with staggering potential; (ii) the warnings set out in PRE for gas detection scenario contained

no explicit warning of the risk of ignition and explosion of the gas cloud; (iii) was not 

included in PRE conducting training for the explosion scenario; it can be said that the 

migration failed the guidelines contained in the unit's safety studies, including the Safety 

In addition to this fact, we have that as response philosophy to the emergence of BW, the 

Emergency Response Plan (ERP) should contain at least the guidance on training 

requirements and skills, often simulated and tests the response to the emergency structures 

and procedures and responsibilities to be followed in various emergency situations, including 

emergency response activities and action plans.

The Emergency Response Plan comes to training and simulated in three of its items 

(4.1.5, 4.1.6 and 9.3), however, does not define the frequency of simulations to be performed, 

thus contradicting response philosophy of requirement to the emergence of the company 

itself.

Furthermore, the drill scenario and exercises schedule210, contained only a list of the 

same scenarios that comprise incident management guide.

As mentioned earlier, the explosive 

atmosphere scenarios (gas not activated) or explosion did not appear among the scenarios 

expected to be simulated by the emergency response team because they were not 

contemplated herein.

Another important fact established during the investigation211 conducted by ANP was to 

verify the absence of simulated records for scenarios which required the drive of external 

resources to the unit such as those indicated in PRE Grade II and III.

       In this sense, it could be seen the installation operator not adequately identified from 

studies of safety standards and good engineering practice, the accident scenarios for which 

should prepare, establishing procedures, resources and simulation.

So there was a failure in 

planning emergency situations.

Such failure is considered one of the causes from the Causal 

Factor "Personnel Exposure" and contravenes the provisions of item 14.2.3 of SGSO.

Root Cause n° 24: Demobilization of gathering points / [4.2.1.2] Lack of 

    After returning the second team of the pump house and before the third team entry, there 

was a partial demobilization of meeting places so that people could have lunch.

This order 

came from the offshore incident command and was published on the platform from the public 

announcement system, commonly known as "iron mouth." There are versions of this 

demobilization was also made by telephone to muster stations with emergency functions or 

the guidance of demobilization it was only for the people who had emergency functions and 

who were in the cafeteria.

The fact is that people, both with emergency response functions as 

housed in a temporary shelter, were demobilized as the emergency unfolded yet.

     Most striking in this finding is that the decision to demobilize the people was taken while 

the fixed gas detector (73AB326) indicated very high level of gas in the pump house and upon 

the confirmation by the previous teams that had gone to the house of pumps, that the situation 

in that environment was real.

Collected evidence indicated that the measuring of the second 

crew member's portable detector registered 100% LIE.

Thus, all data showed that there was 

an emergency situation.

As the unit had a rule que people would not eat lunch with the overall service, people 

went to Their accommodations to ACCOMPLISH the change of clothes.

People in the coffee 

shop meeting place near Were Their accommodation When the explosion occurred and 

several Were injured, with and without gravity.

Two other people in the ward staff were 

inside the elevator que as a result of the explosion, was released to the roof top of houses, 

Causing serious injury to the occupants.A decision to demobilize meeting points for the 

emergence showed low operational discipline and awareness of board leaders about situations 

and conditions that could provoke or escalate the ongoing emergency situation.

The conduct 

of demobilize meeting places made people to be exposed to risks not captured by the study for 

the establishment of temporary shelters212 and acted contrary to typical prohibitions for 

emergency cases, like the use of elevators.

    Thus, based on guidance from the offshore incident command, the meeting place of 

temporary refuge (cafeteria) was demobilized and the meeting points of the infirmary and the 

engine room control room were partially demobilized.

The position of the temporary refuge of 

the meeting point is shown in Figure 129.

In this sense, it could be seen that the installation operator did not promote the awareness of 

the workforce involved in the operation and maintenance on the situations and conditions that 

could cause incidents, setting up failure in the awareness of the workforce.

Such failure is 

considered one of the root causes Causal Factor "People Exhibition" and contravenes the 

provisions of item 4.2.1.2 of SGSO.

Root Cause n° 25: Failure to minimize the personnel exposure upon the 

hazards during the emergency response / [10.2.4] Disregard of reduction of 

human exposure to the consequences of eventual failures of systems and 

   As already mentioned, to identify an emergency situation, people should go to their 

respective meeting points.

People in emergency response functions should go to locations 

outside of the temporary shelters, to be ready to act to mitigate the ongoing event.

This fact 

demands that in the emergency response plan of the planning is done analysis for the risks of 

exposures to humans are minimized.

   In the accident in question, the rupture of the bulkhead between the pump house and engine 

room caused the death of an operator in their meeting point in the engine room control room 

In the upper deck, two people were injured seriously in their meeting point to be 

affected by pressure near the fast rescue boat.

      During the investigation of the incident it was not possible to demonstrate that the 

planning for response to accidents considered the need to minimize the exposure of 

individuals to risks during response procedures to emergencies, thus avoiding an escalation of 

the accident scenarios.

In this sense, it was not possible to demonstrate the existence of 

studies to assess the safety of the meeting points for people with emergency response function 

against the possible accident scenarios and indicate the alternative meeting points for cases in 

which the meeting points set the Security Plan (Safety Plan) of the unit were considered 

      Hence, it is found that the installation of the operator did not consider the need to 

minimize human exposure to a result of possible system failures.

Such failure is considered 

one of the root causes Causal Factor "People Exhibition" and contravenes the provisions of 

item 10.2.4 of SGSO.

Root Cause n° 26: Brigade exposure / [14.4] Unidentified response 

       It was observed that, after being taken actions in order to stop the equipment and carry 

out the closing of the cargo handling system valves, the unit did not have systems and 

procedures previously established for the control and elimination of explosive atmosphere.

For example, the only asset available in the pump house for emergency control system was 

the CO2 system was assigned to the fire scenario, with no provision for use for explosive 

atmospheres.

There was also the ventilation system of the pump house that was stopped 

automatically in the event of gas detection in this environment.

Thus, there was no system 

previously dimensioned to act in the event of an explosive atmosphere in order to reduce it or 

eliminate it.

      Once the emergency situation it was not a fire (scenario set out in PRE) and due to lack of 

definition of resources and mitigating actions to the explosive atmosphere scenario in PRE, 

fell to OIM (offshore incident commander function) decision making at the time of 

emergency, the latter decided to send three teams successively to the pump house for site 

      PRE unit establishes the responsibilities for Commander Incident Offshore, calling it 

"strategist".

Among these responsibilities, it must: (i) conduct the analysis of the situation 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

based on the information and resources available; (ii) control events to prevent their 

escalation; (iii) maintain communications with the Operations Manager (when possible); (iv) 

minimize the risk to personnel, among others.

      It is noteworthy that there was no provision in PRE for external support to the actions 

unfolded on board and that the drills only contemplated the unit features drive, without being 

trained or evaluated the relationship between Commander Incident Offshore and other 

external actors the FPSO CDSM.

      According to testimonies collected by the ANP, the use of the brigade team for the 

evaluation of gas detections was common in any environment, both in the process plant as 

indoors.

     Thus, the decision of sending response teams to the pump house was taken with the 

acceptance of the risks involved with the use of available resources on board and where we 

highlight the following facts: 

 The first team was sent to pump house for conducting the investigation of the leak 

point, despite the confirmed gas detection at the room (all three detectors located in 

the pump house background had alarm).

 After returning the first team of the pump house, the leader of the brigade reported to 

offshore incident commander that there was leakage of liquid in the form of dripping, 

forming a pool of about two square meters below the flange.

Even after confirmation 

of the actual situation, the decision was made the second team sent to the pump house 

to assess the required maintenance; 

 The second team returned from the pump house to breathe fresh air, aware of the 

information that the portable detector had measured 100%from the LIE; 

 A third team was sent to the interior of the pump house with absorbent blankets the 

SOPEP kit, already pressurized fire hose, ladder and tools.

       In the case of a leak with explosive atmosphere training indoors, there is a possibility 

event scheduling scenario to fire and / or explosion.

Therefore, resources should be provided 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

(systems and procedures) so that once there was such an event, there are conditions so that the 

crew can act to control the situation by eliminating the explosive atmosphere for subsequent 

return to routine operations.

       Ensuring availability of response resources, upon the prior identification of accident 

scenarios is shared responsibility between the Concessionaire and the operator of the facility 

as companies with established safety management systems.

It is the workforce have adherence 

to the practices and policies of the company, through training and availability features that 

ensure that management systems are in fact implemented.

It is not for one or a few people on 

board of a facility, set in the middle of an emergency how best to act.

In this sense, it can be seen that the Concessionaire and the installation operator failed to 

identify the necessary response resources, including systems and equipment, and the adequacy 

of existing resources has not been certified.

Such failure is considered one of the root causes 

Causal Factor "People Exhibition" and contravenes the provisions of item 14.4 of SGSO.

Root Cause n° 27: Exposure to third party detached from the brigade 

towards the explosive environment / [14.7] Inadequate mechanisms for the review 

     The emergency response technical team is an existing resource in other platforms operated 

According to the testimonies collected by the ANP, the role of this 

technical advisory team was that the Incident Commander Offshore take off doubts about 

specific topics.

     The assembly of the team response technical emergency was carried out informally, on 

08/02/2015, without changing the procedures, including the Emergency Response Plan unit, 

conducting adequate training and formalize the team, a fact that is another sign of the low 

operational discipline to follow the plans and established procedures.

Thus, the duties of Time 

emergency response technician were unclear and people who had response function were not 

used to this response structure.

     It was shown on hearings that the technical team was created at the suggestion of new 

IOM, who previously worked on a platform operated by BW Offshore that had such a team in 

213 Station Bill P-63, collected in the diligence of SGSO_2015_028.

As the FPSO CDSM was originally operated by Prosafe, the answer 

structure did not provide such a feature.

     Despite the meeting point in the CCR (control room) to be close to the Incident 

Commander Offshore, the members of Team emergency response brigade Technical 

accompanied the three teams that entered the house of bombs and explosive atmosphere.

do this, other firefighters gave their brigade costumes for the members of Team emergency 

response Technical and thus other people besides the firefighters were exposed to the scenario 

unfolding.

Creating a team emergency response technician is an organizational and operational 

change that affects response procedures and therefore demanded that the Emergency 

Response Plan was revised to the proper implementation of the new response structure.

Accordingly, it can be seen that the requirements for response plan review to the emergency 

installation operator proved to be inadequate.

This inadequacy is considered one of the matrix 

causes Causal Factor "People Exposure" and contravenes the provisions of item 14.7 of 

Causal Factor nº 7: Ignition of the explosive environment 

By combining a source of ignition in an explosive atmosphere, lots of chemical energy 

was released due to combustion reaction.

By the effects of the geometry of the environment 

and the characteristics of the potentially explosive atmosphere, the resulting pressure, drag 

forces and the projectiles were able to cause harm to people, to installation and equipment.

The mixture of fuel and oxidizer in flammable proportion is called the explosive 

atmosphere.

Each fuel has its explosive range, located between the lower explosive limit 

(LIE) and the upper explosive limit (LSE).

The explosive atmosphere was achieved through 

the mixture of oxygen from the ambient air to the gaseous fuel derived from the variation of 

pressure imposed on the condensed while leaked.

The response actions and condensate 

mixing characteristics are factors contributing to the increase in fuel gas concentration in the 

explosive atmosphere.

For the occurrence of explosion, besides the geometry of the environment and potentially 

explosive atmosphere, a sufficient energy source to initiate the combustion reaction is needed.

This source of energy is known as ignition source.

When seeking data on sources of ignition explosion accidents, a publication of Health and 

Safety Executive (HSE)214, which cites data from five other databases or previous 

publications, which presents in 46% of cases explosion of vapors or gases ignition sources are 

As searched reference which deals with control and mitigate fire and explosion in production 

facilities offshore215, possible ignition sources for a burst can be divided into: (i) calls, (ii) hot 

surfaces, (iii) Chemical reactions, (iv) compression heat, (v) atmospheric discharges, (vi) arcs 

and electric sparks (vii) mechanical sparks and (viii) static electricity.

For the high percentage of accidents in which it is not possible to determine the source of 

ignition, one has to take into account that those sources of ignition that are not easily viewed 

or perceived contribute significantly, and between these electrical or mechanical sparks and 

static electricity its best representatives.

Considering that the determination of the source of ignition is not immediate and demand 

analysis of various elements, the mechanisms of action of each ignition source, having 

considered several facts that support or refute the possible scenarios were studied.

The facts 

considered concern condensate characteristics stored, House Design features of bombs and 

data on human action (decisions and actions taken during the emergency response).

Importantly, that, according to data shown in the accident timeline, the concentration of 

flammable gases had already reached 100% of the lower explosive limit (LEL), increasing the 

range of explosion, prior to the time of the explosion.

As this detector it was a portable 

detector used by one of the members of the emergency response team, cannot be said that the 

environment gas concentration left the explosive range between detection of 100% LEL and 

another because Such variation may be due to the displacement of the person who carried the 

In addition, by holding that there was a stop ventilation of the house pumps, the 

entire inventory of gas condensate produced by the leak was still on site.

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

In this way, it was considered unlikely the ignition sources listed below: 

(i) Flame 

Such ignition source is the existence of combustion reaction, heating the flammable gases 

to temperature above its ignition temperature.

All ignition sources most likely would be 

subject equipment to flame, such as flare, process furnaces, heaters or the flame boilers, 

internal combustion engines, welding or cutting, cooking facilities or smoke (cigarette lighters 

or matches).

There was no equipment subject to calls inside the pump room (blast site).

The pump was 

driven stripping steam, therefore there is no internal combustion engine in place.

There was 

executing cutting or welding operations on site of the explosion and no fire report observed 

within the pump room prior to the explosion.

For these reasons, it is considered such a source of ignition as unlikely.

(ii) Hot surfaces 

Hot surfaces can be a source of ignition, since the surface may be at a temperature higher 

than the ignition temperature of the flammable gas.

To consider a hot surface as a likely 

source of ignition must be taken into account, so the gas ignition temperature in question.

Figuring among the possible situations that can facilitate the formation of a hot surface: the 

welding activities, combustion gases from equipment subject to flame or the exhaust motor, 

incandescent lamps, equipment and hot process pipes, frictional heat from rotating machines 

poorly lubricated, among others.

When analyzing the pump room design, it turns out that did not exist internal combustion 

engines, equipment subject to flame, incandescent or rotating machinery inside.

Also there 

was welding operation taking place inside at the time of the explosion.

It was concluded that 

the only possible source of heat would be the power the steam stripping pump.As per API RP 

2216216 it states that, in general, Hydrocarbon a hot surface ignition is only plausible if the 

216 Item 5.2 do API RP 2216 - Ignition Risk of Hydrocarbon Liquids and Vapors by Hot Surfaces in the Open 

Air

surface temperature is at least 180 ° C higher than the minimum ignition temperature of the 

In order to determine the properties of the fluid that leaked it was conducted by an 

analysis operator217 of the condensed material stored in tanks 2C, 3C and 5C, after the 

accident.

Since the leaked fluid on the day of the accident also consisted of condensed 

material produced in the unit, it can be said that the composition of the contents of these tanks 

similar to the fluid that caused the accident.

The result of analysis is shown in Figure 132 

As can be seen, the auto ignition temperature was found to be 244 ° C for the sample 

Thus, this source of ignition is sustained 

only if hot spots are evident at a temperature range of 425 ° C or more.

According to information provided by the plant operator 218, steam was fed at a 

Thus, one can rule out the hypothesis of a steam leaks have caused the 

ignition of the condensed vapor.

Figure 132 – condensed material test result 

(iii) 

 Chemical reactions  

This form consists of ignition in the presence of exothermic chemical reactions.

The heat 

generated by such reactions constitute a source of ignition for the combustion reaction.

It 

stands out among the reactions known for the offshore environment the reaction between iron 

sulfide and air.

Iron sulfide is steel corrosion product in the presence of hydrogen sulfide 

Second reference that recommends best practices for cleaning of oil storage tanks219, wet 

the surface containing iron sulfide formed dissipates heat and insulates the iron sulfide 

deposits from the air, thereby reducing the possibility of spontaneous ignition.

Furthermore, the condensed material produced in the unit does not contain H2S, so this 

hypothesis ignition source was considered unlikely.

Upon the hearings, the explosion 

occurred as he was used water jet on the location of the pool.

Therefore, it is considered the 

219 Item 8.2.2.1 of API RP 2016 - Guidelines and Procedures for Entering and Cleaning Petroleum Storage Tanks 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

source of ignition unlikely chemical reaction, since water would have absorbed the heat from 

an exothermic reaction.

(iv) Heat compression 

Such ignition source was the rapid compression of the flammable mixture (fuel-air 

mixture), similarly to what occurred in the cylinder of an internal combustion Diesel engine 

The volatile hydrocarbon leaked to the environment, then the fuel gas was at 

atmospheric pressure.

The stripping pump, which constitutes the only possible source existing 

compression in the environment, was stopped at the time of explosion.

Therefore, it is 

considered that source of ignition, such as unlikely.

(v) Atmospheric discharges 

     Such ignition source consists of incidence of an atmospheric discharge (lightning) on a 

location in which there is the presence of flammable mixture.

It can be discarded as an 

ignition source, since the area in question is housed and there is bad weather record with the 

incidence of rays on the incident.

In addition, reference surveyed said that the offshore project 

is usually able to ensure that lightning does not constitute a relevant risk source, except for 

some well operations involving explosives or gases released by atmospheric vent, situations 

that have no correlation with the accident in question.

(vi) Ignition by arcs and electrical sparkles 

As per ISO 13702220, an electric spark is a discharge of electrical current through the gap 

between two objects with different electrical charges.

Electrical sparks can originate in 

electrical equipment and may contain enough energy to ignite flammable mixture.

Electric 

arcs occur when an electrical circuit driving current is interrupted.

Among the sources of 

sparks and arcing, stand out electric motors and generators, circuit breakers, relays, batteries, 

ignition mechanisms for equipment exposed to flame, internal systems of internal combustion

offshore production installations- Requirements and guidelines

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

engines, electric lamps, cathodic protection systems with impressed current and malfunction 

of electrical equipment and wiring.

When considering the possibility of ignition equipment present inside the pump house 

should be borne in mind that it was hazardous area zone type 1, according to area 

classification drawing221, based on API RP 505222.

Thus, if the equipment inside were suitable for use in such an environment, they had been 

designed, constructed and installed so as to minimize the risk to constitute a source of 

ignition.

Stationary equipment with electrical circuits in pump house were: three fixed detectors, 

two CCTV cameras (4 and 5) audible and visual alarm signal, landline and fixtures normal 

Portable equipment present in the pump house at the time 

of the explosion were portable gas detectors and communicators radios.

It was found that all 

were rated for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, in accordance with policies and 

standards, particularly European.

Therefore, considering the equipment in conditions "as good as new" equipment present in 

the pump house should be safe for use in explosive atmospheres and do not constitute an 

ignition source, except in the case of having some damage to their protection.

As the equipment of the pump house, for the most part, have been severely damaged due 

to the explosion, one cannot determine whether any equipment was damaged before the 

explosion, which could have been a source of ignition.

Additionally, the presence of an explosive atmosphere for a prolonged period of time, 

with no explosion makes it more likely that the source of ignition has occurred due to a 

condition or event that developed in the pump while home environment before the explosion, 

so if the ignition was caused by sparks or electrical arcs resulting from damage to electrical

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

equipment present in the pump house, this damage must have occurred moments before the 

explosion is caused by the action of people who were present there at the time.

The facts collected during the investigation did not show the damage to the equipment 

during the response actions to the condensed material leak, either to refute.

Therefore, this 

hypothesis was considered unlikely.

(vii) 

Ignition source by mechanical sparks 

As per ISO 13702223, a mechanical spark is the energy generated by mechanical friction 

created by mechanical tools and by falling objects.

Other references relate this type of ignition 

to action belts or other moving parts of equipment poorly lubricated, allowing metal-to-metal 

friction.

Analyzing House Project pumps and the events on the day of the accident, it is concluded 

that a probability for this type of ignition source was probably caused by the use of 

inappropriate tools to hazardous environment.

Maintenance staff was sent to the pump house 

in order to tighten the flange bolts where the spill occurred, and to do so, it took several tools 

for this environment.

It was shown that the tools taken to the pump house were not suitable for use in hazardous 

The tools were taken into the pump room by the maintenance crew consisted of two 

wrenches, one chrome and one common carbon steel.

Because it is ferrous alloy, these were 

not adhering to the standard tools of tools do not generate mechanical spark.

Such tools when 

used to effect the desired repair, or even accidental drop thereof, may have caused a spark 

ignited flammable mixture.

In this way, due to some mechanical ignition spark is considered 

probable and its cause is related to the action of people during incident response, due to the 

use of inappropriate tools for use in explosive atmospheres.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

As per publication of OSHA225, of iron or steel tools can cause sparks which may be a 

source of ignition in the presence of flammable substances.

Where this risk exists, should be 

used to spark resistant tools made of non-ferrous materials which are stored or used 

explosives, flammable and highly volatile liquids, tools manufactured with non-ferrous metal 

alloys reduce the risk of power generation ignition, either by impact or by friction.

(viii) Ignition source by static electricity  

The ignition by static electricity occurs when two objects move relative to one another 

with a certain proximity, with the electric charge due to friction or induction.

Thus, electric 

charges may be generated through flow of gases and liquids or by rubbing and friction created 

by the activities performed by the people within an explosive atmosphere.

If objects are not 

grounded or electrically connected so as to remove the electric charges generated, these 

accumulated charges can be downloaded in the form of an electric spark.

This spark may be 

able to trigger a flammable mixture.

The reviewed literature makes extensive reference to the dangers related to static 

electricity created by friction as the costumes, when walking.

It is noteworthy among the 

static electricity-generating potential situations in which there is a flow of a conductive fluid 

through the hose or tube, such as filling operations containers or tanks, supply vehicles, 

washing with hose, etc.

Analyzing the events in the accident in question, there is one of the situations that 

constitute a potential source of static electricity: the use of fire hose to wash the place where 

had formed the condensed material pool.

The facts that occurred prior to the explosion show great probabilistic relationship 

between sources of ignition from static electricity, for two reasons:  

(i) as the story of one of the witnesses, the explosion occurred immediately after request 

was made for the increase in water pressure in the hose used to clean the condensed material 

pool in the pump house floor; 

225 OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) publication 3680 – Hand and Power Tools 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

(ii) the simulation of dispersion and explosion226 performed by the utility indicates the 

position just above the condensed material pool as a likely location for the ignition of the 

flammable mixture.

This position is consistent with where would possibly focusing the jet 

Thus, if the ignition source in this case is by static electricity, the ANP research team 

found that it is more likely that this ignition source is related to the use of water jet using the 

fire hose.

When reviewing the documentation of the unit to find mention of the risk of ignition from 

static electricity, mismatched information between two documents were found.

The document 

recommends safe practices insulation work227 relates to static electricity as a danger.

In the 

item referring to the identification of hazards associated with insulation failure, static 

electricity is listed as a danger: 

"The vessel cleaning using high pressure water, solvent or steam 

blasting can create static electricity hazards.

Guidance and advice on 

how to control the generation of electrostatic charges due to blasting 

and other activities are described in British Standard Electrostatic, 

Code of Practice to avoid hazards due to static electricity".

Said British Standard (European Code CENELEC TR 50404228) states: 

"Nonconductive hoses are not recommended if a flammable 

atmosphere can be present." 

 According to the data sheet of the hoses firefighting229, the same were made of synthetic 

rubber tube, so its material was non-conductive.

Thus, its use in flammable atmosphere was

So the lack of knowledge about the dangers associated with the use of flammable 

atmosphere in hose denotes at least unfamiliarity with good security practices.

In spite of these documents mention the dangers related to static electricity, the work 

permit procedure BW230 reinforces this lack of technical knowledge on the subject.

In this 

document are mentioned as examples of jobs that do not involve ignition sources work 

blasting water / sand and clean with, or blasting water.

Figure 133 and Figure 134 show the excerpts of the document that make such a claim:

This statement that operations with use of water jets are not sources of ignition as well as 

being in conflict with information contained in another document, it is not compliant to 

several references of good practice, including the standard ISO 13702:1999231 and the 

Both cited fluids with high-speed outputs (the high 

pressure water sprays, the gas jets) as a potential source of static electricity sufficient to 

promote ignition of an explosive atmosphere.

Therefore, the procedure for Work Permit, 

which was a document widespread within the work team, contained incorrect information 

about the dangers associated with the blasting of water.

For the analysis of the information collected on each type of ignition source, we used the 

tool "matrix of facts and hypotheses", presented in the methodology used 233.

 In the rows of 

the matrix were the various assumptions related to the ignition source that caused the 

explosion; the columns were related analyzed facts that corroborate or refute each hypothesis, 

all of them identified by the ANP research team throughout the research process.

intersection "hypothesis x fact that" the correlation is analyzed between the two, providing 

for: if the fact supports the hypothesis (+) if the rejects (-) was no apparent relationship 

between the two (NA) or lack of information available to decide on this fact (?).

The 

situations and facts that were considered irrelevant or unlikely to define the sources of 

ignition have been omitted from that table.

The resulting matrix of this analysis is presented in

       Regarding the data from the analysis arranged in the matrix, it was possible to classify 

each hypothesis for the source of ignition according to the following criteria: 

 Likely Source: there are facts that support this hypothesis; 

 Unlikely source: there are no facts that support this hypothesis.

After the analysis presented, they remained as probable cases: a mechanical ignition 

sparks or static electricity.

Analyzing together the mechanisms of action of these sources of ignition and the greater 

likelihood that the ignition occurred due to some condition or event introduced in the bomb 

moments home environment before the explosion, it is concluded that the ignition source was 

caused or at least enhanced by the response actions of third team that entered the pump house, 

even with explosive atmosphere in that environment.

Additionally, the results of CFD simulation (computer fluid dynamics) held by Petrobras 

to analyze the explosive atmosphere and the explosion aboard the FPSO CDSM indicated two 

most likely locations for the source of ignition, one being the place where the staff worked 

immediately before the explosion.

By the facts, it was concluded that the root cause for the ignition source of this accident 

was introduced by the action of people in potentially explosive atmospheres.

The Causal Factor called "ignition of explosive atmosphere" is shown in Figure 135 and 

its cause is presented below.

Figure 135 - causal factor # 7 - ignition of explosive atmosphere 

Root Cause n° 28: Ignition source introduced triggered by the action of 

people inside the explosive environment / [15.2.1] Lack of proper/specific 

instructions for the tasks performance 

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

For these reasons, whether the source of ignition was caused by mechanical spark or static 

electricity, the immediate cause for both hypotheses now considered more likely is the action 

of people in potentially explosive atmospheres, and the root cause for both cases is the same: 

the lack of clear / specific instructions for carrying out the tasks of emergency response teams.

In the absence of such instructions, the emergency response team established procedures and 

used equipment or tools not suitable for use in explosive atmosphere.

As the occurrence of a gas leak it was an emergency situation, the actions to be taken to 

mitigate this situation not constitute an escalation risk should be included in the Emergency 

The lack of this information in the Emergency Response Plan sets is therefore 

a lack of clear and specific instructions for carrying out the activities safely at odds with 

Mitigation action analysis 

The emergency response structure previously established for the FPSO City of St.

Matthew, which can be mobilized in the event of emergency, in order to define 

responsibilities and actions to be taken to the emergency control and mitigation of its effects, 

as it can be synthesized from Figure 136.

Figure 136 – Estructure of Response to Emergency

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

The first level of response is the Plan Response Unit Emergency - PRE-CSM (Emergency 

Response and Contingency Plan - FPSO CSM), which was prepared by BW Offshore, aiming 

to protect the assets of the company and shipboard personnel possible damage from incidents.

PRE-CSM defines three categories of incidents (1-lowest, second-largest and third-

catastrophic) for which it should be triggered.

For the category of incidents 2:03, the 

procedure indicates that Petrobras must provide any additional external resources to the 

installation that are needed to manage the emergency.

Such request must be made by the 

Audit Committee of Petrobras on board at the request of OIM.

The second level of response is the Response Plan for Emergency Operating of Espírito 

Santo – PRE da UO-ES234 which adds response structure to the emergence available on the 

drive and aims to establish procedures and actions that can safeguard the lives, stabilize and 

reduce the consequences of the incident and protect the environment and assets.

The third level of response, which can be triggered by UO-ES depending on the 

emergency features, it is the Mobilization Plan for Support to Emergencies - PMAE-EP235.

This plan aims to establish mobilization of corporative area shares of E&P and integration 

with other areas of the Petrobras deal to supply specialized features of E & P to Operations 

and Services when exhausted the remedies provided in the Response Plan for Emergency 

Unit.

The response actions to the accident after the explosion showed that it was classified as 

It is observed that even the PRE taking its structure and its responsibility for 

setting the involvement of Petrobras in response to accidents Category 2 or 3, it was not 

possible to observe the formal establishment of this liability in contracts between BW and 

Petrobras or even that the PRE has been approved by Petrobras.

BW Offshore had a corporate procedure for emergency response236 which governs the 

structured response to an incident or crisis in an offshore unit or office on the ground of the 

This procedure establishes guidelines for the preparation of emergency response 

plans for its facilities, covering both the situations where the company leads the emergency 

response as in where the company only provides support your contractor.

The same procedure 

cites the structuring of response actions in addition to the emergency response plan of the 

premises.

      The corporate procedure classifies incident on three levels (1, 2 and 3).

Level 1 incidents 

are processed in the framework of the platform and the respective emergency response plan 

itself, not requiring the activation of external resources of the BW response.

Fall into this 

level event less likely to damage to life, environmental impact, damage to assets or the 

company's reputation.

In the procedure are listed as examples MEDVAC, smaller fires and 

leak contained hydrocarbons.

The actions demonstrated in response to accident FPSO CDSM 

between the gas alarm and explosion demonstrate that the incident during that time interval is 

      Incidents of type 2 are the events that are managed the edge of the platform, but with 

possible technical assistance from onshore staff, that does not necessarily require the 

activation of all the emergency structure in offices ashore.

They are identified as incidents 

where there is a possibility of damage to life, environmental impact, damage to assets or the 

company's reputation.

They are exemplified as charts of process plants, blackout, controllable 

fire and lower release of hydrocarbons or chemicals.

Analyzing the settings for the accident 

levels 1 and 2, there is considerable similarity in the definitions and boundaries are not clearly 

established classification.

     In turn, to level 3 incident (emergency or crisis), there is total mobilization of emergency 

response teams on the ground, both as contractor of the BW, in addition to internal and 

external support services.

In the procedure are some examples of this type of incident, such as 

an explosion or fire large, multiple fatalities or serious injury, compelling security threat, ship

stability loss, among others.

After the explosion, the shares showed that the incident was 

classified at level 3.

The response structure for the emergence of BW level 3 incidents is shown in Figure.

Figure 137 - Response Structure BW Offshore 

Under the procedure, the BW Offshore Singapore is the main emergency source of 

support to the entire fleet of BW.

The office of BW Offshore in Oslo provides support 

services to the BW Singapore, particularly with regard to assistance to families of relatives of 

BW employees domiciled in Norway and Europe.

The leader of the emergency response management team (ERMT) has the initial 

allocation, during the emergency in the first meeting with the team, confirming the role to be 

played by BW in emergency, can the company exercise the organization's leadership role or 

support to the contractor.

The operational offices in the country of origin of the facility involved in the accident, in 

turn, will have as its main task the customer contact and support for ERMT in Singapore.

The 

roles and responsibilities of each office vary in the specific case of the office that provides 

support to the FPSO CDSM expected execution holder as signaled in Figure 138.

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

Figure 138 - Operating Office Support 

In the accident FPSO CDSM response structure on land BW was thrown and locally 

concentrated in the company's office in Rio de Janeiro, because during the investigation 

process ANP noticed a clear deficiency in the BW office structure in Victoria, with only three 

people with technical bias in its structure.

Thus, the BW Petrobras support structure was 

based on the presence of Operations Manager in response activities that were carried out in 

the crisis room mounted at Petrobras headquarters in Victoria (OU-ES).

The BW's corporate procedure for emergency responses indicates the need for periodic 

simulated accidents level.

During the investigation it was shown that the FPSO CDSM 

performed only under simulated installation and in the case of oil discharge scenarios 

(environmental requirements of the authorities).

There was the simulated planning to respond 

to events with multiple injuries and fatalities, that is, this structure had not been tested or 

established.

Organizational Structures Response Features - Petrobras 

The Emergency Response Plan OU-ES presented as additional documents, the Emergency 

Response Plans of some units operated by Petrobras237,238 and also presents the following 

statement about emergency scenarios considered: 

"The accident scenarios have been described based on risk analyzes stored 

in SINDOTEC in SMSNet records in contracted emergency plans in the 

historical accident of the OU-ES interface and emergency plans." 

Contrary to this claim, the risk analyzes and plans for response to emergencies FPSO 

CDSM have not been approved or stored by Petrobras procedures or systems not being 

considered when planning for emergencies of the Espírito Santo Basin.

Corroborates the fact that Petrobras response plan not considered as a supplementary 

document or reference the Emergency Response Plans to the chartered units, including the 

Emergency Response Plan for the FPSO CDSM, developed by BW and expressed Petrobras 

responsibilities.

It is noteworthy that the Emergency Response Plan to the OU-ES is 

considered a complementary use of existing units in the sea and therefore should be 

considered in defining the necessary response resources such as recommended by the ANP 

Resolution No.

The Plan of Emergency Response OU-ES presents a breakdown of the communication 

structure should be established during an accident and the organizational structure of response 

should be triggered, as shown in Figure 139 and Figure 140, respectively.

Figure 140 - Communication Flowchart - organizational structure of response should be triggered 

PRE OU-ES also presents the following information about the structure of communication 

and organizational response structure: 

 The initial report of the accident to the Organizational Structure Response (EOR) must 

be made immediately by the Emergency Call Center that communicates the receipt of 

information to the ER, Integrated Coordinator of Operations (CIOP), Unit Operations 

Coordinator, Response Actions coordinator (in case of oil spill) and the Advisory 

 In case of platform, the observer is the maritime unit Manager or Petrobras Inspector.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

 The initial communication is understood as preliminary in nature, ensuring the 

immediate activation of the Emergency Plan of the OU-ES and ensuring speed at the 

beginning of the response actions.

 When the plan is triggered, the Central Manager of EOR is the representative of the 

Operations Unit (UO-ES) and takes over the operation as a whole, is responsible for 

directing all activities related to the incident.

 In Annex A of the plan is described who can perform each of the eight roles of ROS in 

terms of the organizational structure of Petrobras (name and position of the person).

However, it was observed that in Figure 140 is not in the role of the Integrated Operations 

Coordinator (CIOP), although it provided the actuation by the Emergency Call Center and it 

has been triggered during the emergency of the day 02.11.2015.

In addition, as can be seen in Figure 140, Unit Operations Coordinator function is not 

included as part of the EOR and the PRE OU-ES does not provide the definition of who 

should exercise this function, only consisting on such attribution in the structure of 

communication of the accident (Figure 139).

However, it was observed that the Operations 

Coordinator of the FPSO CDSM attended the EOR in managing the accident on 02.11.2015.

The lack of alignment of procedures to conduct carried out in practice was justified during 

the audit by representatives of Petrobras as follows: When a unit is operated by Petrobras 

itself, the Unit Operations Coordinator function coincides with the Equity Coordinator 

function Response (Installation).

Whereas, in the case of chartered units, this coincidence of 

positions does not occur, it was that the latent Response Plan Emergency OU-ES is not fully 

adjusted to the situations in which the units are not operated by Petrobras.

This lack of OU-ES PRE adjustment was also observed with regard to planning functions, 

Logistics and Administration.

This is because in such a plan these functions are described as 

taking place only represents Petrobras, which applies to cases where the units are operated by 

In the case of chartered units, as performed during the audit explanation, the 

functions are exercised both by Petrobras as the operator of the installation, unlike what is 

provided in the Plan.

Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels 

Superintendence of Operational safety and the Environment – SSM 

Another point worth mentioning is that, considering the two response structures set up by 

the operator of the installation (Figure 137) and Petrobras (Figure 140), could not be 

identified to establish an interface between the two structures that demonstrate a systematic 

action joint between the two companies to manage the crisis.

Regarding the definition of resources necessary for emergency response, it is noteworthy 

that the PRE OU-ES has, as a reference document, the Standard Compliance N-2644239, 

which rules on the content of Petrobras' contingency plans.

Said standard establishes 

minimum criteria for the preparation of emergency response plans for the units, Petrobras 

facilities and activities.

According to the standard, the plan should provide the material and human resources as 

follows: (i) "To be related the equipment, response material and human resources, consistent 

with the actions necessary to control emergencies, in its various types, dimensions and 

emergency scenarios"; (ii) "The list must contain both resources belonging to the installation 

and those outsourced" (iii) "Material resources must be related: a) type and operational 

characteristics; b) quantity available; c) location; d) the estimated maximum shift time to the 

place of use; e) people required for operation "and (iv)" Human resources should be related: 

a) expertise; b) quantity available; c) location; d) Maximum estimated time of travel to the 

 Accordingly, the PRE OU-ES has the material resources and human resources, as shown 

in the following table:

Triggered resources according to the PRE Unit 

As can be seen from the analysis of material resources listed in the table, all appeals are 

exclusively environmental focus, i.e.

they are resources for the management of potential 

environmental problems.

Resources for other emergencies are not listed, which goes against 

the norm of the company and demonstrates that the OU-ES does not guarantee the availability 

of controllers for all accident scenarios.

Moreover, as the PRE OU-ES is a unit PRE 

complement, should present the resources available to each of the scenarios identified in the 

PRE CDSM, which did not occur.

In addition, the PRE OU-ES, the Central Manager of EOR has the responsibility to drive 

the PMAE-EP to enlarge the resources available to control the emergency.

Once triggered the 

PMAE-EP, functions triggered the plan will be part of the EOR unit that coordinates and 

oversees the emergency response.

All corporate emergency support should be built according 

to his specialty the EOR that is acting in response.

The response actions and resources are set 

out in PRE each unit, leaving the PMAE-EP actions complement or assist the actions 

developed there.

Aeromedical Aid 

In specific regard to air medical transport resources, the PRE OU-ES presents as 

supplementary document, the procedure comes to attending emergency cases and medical 

emergencies in the Facilities UO-ES240 and also, in Annex H (Operational Response 

Procedures) provides that the aircraft available for emergency use should have his Victory 

exit to the fire and explosion scenario, as shown in Figure 141.

However, it could not be identified in any of the two documents (procedure that deals with 

air medical care and Annex H of the PRE OU-ES) availability requirements of these aircraft, 

for example in terms of minimum required quantity, availability criteria of aircraft , criteria

In fact, the PRE OU-ES, the PMAE-EP and its related documents did not describe the 

resources necessary for emergency response for each of accident scenarios and therefore

 Accident troubleshooting capability  

As already mentioned, there was response elaboration organization on board of the FPSO 

CDSM which provided a command structure, headed by OIM as the Offshore Incident 

Commander (CIO).

It was found that, despite the involvement of many people in the response 

structure aboard the FPSO CDSM, training to deal with major emergencies of BWO was 

concentrated in the IOM, through training courses as "Major Emergency Management" and 

"Crisis Management".

The brigade, in turn, had forecast courses as: (i) advanced firefighting; (ii) course of 

survival and rescue boats, (iii) team maneuvers and combat aviation fire; (iv) first aid and (v) 

In assessing the response to the accident structure provided by Petrobras, it reported that 

on 02/11/2015 initially adopted a response system that was not organized as the Incident 

Command System (ICS), as is provided in its existing procedure in occasion.

visualizing the consequences of the accident and the difficulties presented for the control of 

the event, it was decided that the response structure should be organized as established in the 

ICS242.

On the first day of the incident the post of command of response actions was played by 

Petrobras official in the Central Emergency Manager function (GCE), like Petrobras provided 

the procedure in force, the latter has been occupied by three different people.

On the second 

day, the position of GCE becomes the role of Incident Commander (IC) and starts the use of 

forms of ICS protocol.

It is noteworthy that since the arrival of ANP team on the Vitória crisis 

room late in the evening of the day of the accident was observed structuring and acting as 

advocated by the ICS, although Petrobras representatives have stated that the ICS not fully be 

implemented.

For more refined analysis using an emergency response system the presence minutes were 

recorded in the area on Vitória contingency / ES, containing the names of persons who have 

functions in the structure.

In terms of education / training, of a sample group of eighteen 

people selected from those who had prominent roles in the ICS structure (adviser SMS, 

planning, logistics, operations and command), only 55% of them took part in course on the 

subject with an average time of training of thirteen hours.

One of the people who took over as CI had a capacity of only four hours, since Petrobras 

procedure established that some of the company management positions could not overcome 

this training time.

Of the four who took CI forward crisis environment, it became clear that 

only two of them counted on training in emergency response or had taken part in some 

simulated.

     In regard to past experiences as obtained during simulation, it can be grasped as of the 

sample group as previously shown, only five had such an experience and only by simulation 

offload oil, as demanded by IBAMA, the Table-Top type (without any actual triggering 

Valuable to note, despite such experience, some of these people remained 

only 1h30 at the site of the simulation between its input and output.

     As per all forwarded and analyzed material, both with respect to people onshore or 

offshore of installation operator and concessionaire, it highlighted the need to review and 

improve the related training systems and simulated thoughts to service major accidents and

Recommendation 

    The accident investigation process identified twenty-eight Root Causes, all of them 

correlated with the requirements established by ANP Resolution No.

In addition, sixty recommendations to establish additional requirements have been 

set by the ANP investigation team.

The recommendations are directed to all oil production 

industry and offshore natural gas in order to avoid the recurrence of similar accidents and 

their implementation to be mandatory.

The recommendations are intended to prevent the 

recurrence of similar accidents.

Besides the continuous improvement, it was proposed certain 

recommendations addressed to ANP.

evaluation and implementation of emergency response activities.

Conclusion 

    The occurrence of major accidents gives us the evidence when it is held in synchrony, the 

management failures resulting from a poorly implemented or non-existent hazard 

management system result in great losses.

    The accident which took place on board of the FPSO CDSM evidenced the scenarios 

identified in the hazard assessments were indeed real and the implementation of safeguards 

and hazard analysis of recommendations would have been useful in order to achieve the 

objective of controlling operational risks.

It was also evidenced the bureaucratic approach 

towards risks identification and registration without the adoption of the requirements of 

operational safety management system does not fit into the demands of safety culture for 

operations in Brazilian waters.

    As it indicates the requirements of ANP Resolution No.

43/2007 and other references in the 

safety subject, activities related to the platforms of operation should be monitored proactively 

in regard to the implementation of risk management systems.

    In this sense, it does not establish methods for identifying latent failures of the safety 

management system nor to establish their respective continuous improvement actions 

consisting in mere passivity onward management issues, therefore, it awaits the occurrence of 

accidents and operates in violation of current legislation in the country.

This legislation and 

the terms of the concession agreements establish overlapping responsibilities in respect to 

operational safety, both for the dealer and for the installation's operator, and these cannot be 

delegated and indeed mandatory.

    The lack of minimum requirements for risk management, as acknowledged in such report, 

caused the accident FPSO CDSM on 11/02/2015.

It is expected that situations, conditions and 

recommendations as evidenced by ANP in such report may indicate to the oil industry the 

importance of continuous improvement of safety requirements and typical proactivity of a

good safety culture, which, in addition to ensuring human protection and the environment, 

tend to come to terms with the requirements for a socially responsible industry.
